I purchased this car in 2013 and I'm still paying it off. Its been nothing but useless for my family. I have gotten in many life threatening accidents due to this crappy car and would never purchase anything under the name of holden again. The workers were extremely rude and definitely used me as i payed  50,000+ while i had it. My kids hated it sooo much they lied and said they had a ferrari. that tells you something!

Brought the car 6 weeks ago. Got half way to Sydney from Maitland got stranded on the side of the m1 with my 3 kids. DPF light came on quickly followed by the engine light, over heated and started smoking... we were in perfect driving conditions for it to do a regen but for some reason it didnâ€™t.. Turns out the turbo has been spitting oil into the air intake

We purchased a Captiva 5 new in 2013 with the 2.4lt petrol and 6spd manual just as a means of transport for the wife to use daily to travel to work.Overall it was ok and we never experienced any faults with the car in the 5yrs and 53,000klms of ownership however the 2.4l 4cyl engine is very underpowered and at hwy spds it struggled on big hills.Fuel consumption avg was 8.5l/100 on a hwy run and always sat around 12.5-13l/100klm in city traffic which is terrible for a 4cyl.Overall it was a very comfortable car to travel in but they are basic and the fit and finish is avg.The worse was yet to come when we decided to sell it recently for an automatic car. The service history was up to date and the car was still like new inside and out as I am very particular when looking after them and we still struggled to sell it and only managed to recoup 25% of what we paid for it 5 years earlier. It appears their reputation had caught up with it and we practically had to give it away to offload it. Buyer beware!

Bought Captiva Active 7 seater  on May  First trip was from Melbourne to Sydney and Return. 7 People were  there on the trip (3 kids).  Though we had problem with the luggage space, but the  ride was really good. Economy of average 11L/100KM for overall trip  we got.This car was really cheap in initial price compared to its competitors.  Leather seat,  Sun roof are included in the value. Android /Apple Auto is really a add on  feature. The  A/C vent in the last row make sure that the kids are kept in right temperature. Zone climate control is really a good feature.   Good reversing camera add value to the car.

I have the Holden Captiva Active 7 seat SUV and its been nothing but trouble. We purchased it brand new in 2017 and so far we have had sunroof electronics fail, and the rubber deteriorate. The clock spring needed replacing as the complete front dash lights were flickering. The two front wheel bearings needed replacement as well. All this with only 16,000km on the odo and being purchased and only serviced at Holden. I have also been told by Holden mechanics the Diesels are even worse and to steer clear.

My Captiva 2014 had timing belt snapped in 2018 despite just having 60 K on the clock. I took it to Holden and even though warranty was finished a year and so ago and I was the third owner, they installed a brand new engine on it that they had to manufacture in Korea and ship to Australia. For the time that the car was under repair, I had 2018 top of the range Captiva LTZ turbo diesel as courtesy car that I enjoyed driving more than my original car. Luckily, I did not have to pay a cent for the work done on my car. I don't claim that it was stress free process but excellent customer service at Sutton City Roseberry made it as bareable as possible for me. I really appreciate these guys care and professionalism.

I have found that the newer models of the Holden Captiva are highly reliable and mechanically sound compared to the earlier models 2010/2011 which have had well known problems associated with them, they are fuel efficient and very roomy big boot space and a great family car have take my car interstate maybe 8 times and has been great for every drive.

We purchased a 2010 Holden Captiva for our family. We have only done 147,000kms to date and I have had to pay more than $5000 in repairs to parts above the normal servicing and maintaining. Issues include, keys getting stuck in ignition causing gear box needing replacing, aircon not working and will cost more than $2k to get fixed due to part completely missing from under bonnet. The radio does not automatically turn off anymore, the door beeps when open even though the lights are turned off, Car does not lock with buttons on keys any longer. All these problems are not "easy fix" small problems. They are all LARGE expensive fixes that I can no longer afford. Quoted by Holden it would cost me a further $7000 to get my car back to a good condition.

We purchased a 2010 Holden Captiva for our family. We have only done 147,000kms to date and I have had to pay more than $5000 in repairs to parts above the normal servicing and maintaining. Issues include, keys getting stuck in ignition causing gear box needing replacing, aircon not working and will cost more than $2k to get fixed due to part completely missing from under bonnet. The radio does not automatically turn off anymore, the door beeps when open even though the lights are turned off, Car does not lock with buttons on keys any longer. All these problems are not "easy fix" small problems. They are all LARGE expensive fixes that I can no longer afford.

Ive bought a 2007 captiva, the biggest reason at the beginning is cause my partner loves holden cars.But man, this is one of the worse car we've drove, air conditioning never cool enough, problems after problems, fixing it costed us a bloody fortune. And we finally bought a new car and that will never be another holden car for us again

Bought a brand new Holden Crrraptiva in 2010. Just over 7 years old, had oil leak.Took to the Holden  dealer,  got a quote of 3400$ to fix it. This a major issue with all Holden Captiva and they don't bother about fixing or recalling the carsHolden probably give some extras compared to other Japanese cars, don't fall for the trap.Never ever buy Holdens.

Pretty much everything about car is good, ample legroom front and back. 7 seat option, sunroof, gives roughly 15 ltr/100km petrol consumption in city. Leather seats , android auto and apple play included. Reversing camera and daytime LEDs gives fine touch. Power cigratte socket in boot with aircon vents for 7 seat configuration.

I absolutely love my Holden Captiva lx. Brand New straight off the showroom floor. Love the leg room compared to other cars I've driven.  It's been very economical whether it's long distance or just running around town. Handles well very light steering  for a medium suv. Very little road noise. This car has taken everything we've thrown in it. 7 seater so plenty of room for the family. Wouldn't trade it for the world.

Brought new in 2011, Holden Captiva has only 73 000kms on the clock. So many things have gone wrong. The dash clock resets itself to 1:00 every time you turn the car on. Will cost over $2000 to get fixed. Shock absorbers and now the transmission need replacing. Over $8000 in repairs. Will NEVER buy another Holden.

We bought our 2012 glx diesel captiva brand new and have had continuous problems with it. The motor has been taken out 6 times now. It has been served religiously and at 130,000 kms it now has over $7000 just in parts (not including labour) to repair the auto transmission amongst a bunch of other things. We paid $55,000 which is pretty much money down the toilet now as itâ€™s worth nothing within 6 short years. We have had to pay extra at each servicing for several things like broken bearings, door handles, reverse screen etc. the lady at our servicing Centre laughed and said itâ€™s not worth fixing and to have a nice weekend. Thanks a lot Holden. We will never buy from you ever again.

In Oct. 2017 at about 104,000Km's the transfer case failed and was out of warranty. Upon removing it I found the larger of the two gears that send power to the rear wheels had lost all its teeth. The oil that came out was like a metal soup as all the missing teeth were ground into a powder suspended in the oil. My thought was that the hard-facing on the gear had failed ( if it was ever there), this thought was supported by some other mechanics as well. The smaller gear was largely undamaged.  This gave strength to the thought of faulty manufacture. I was lucky that there was a replacement transfer case in Australia, it was the ONLY one! It cost me $3,000 and took two weeks to come from down south. I also found I needed to replace a CV joint as it was on the way out and as I had it apart I replaced it. I bought a pair of Drive Shafts complete, (GM parts) from an after market supplier for about half the price I could get one shaft alone in Darwin.I took clear photo's of the failed gears and sent them to Holden Customer Care, as I and mechanics from other brand car dealerships considered this was a manufacturing failure. I was told by Holden Customer Care to take it to the local Holden dealer in Darwin (there's only one) so they could report on the condition of the gears. I contacted the dealer who demanded that I bring the vehicle in to them as well as the failed transfer case, why I don't know nor have I been told why. Also it had to be booked in as a job for which I was going to have to pay to have them look at it. As it was the wet season the failed transfer case got rained on and developed some surface rust on some of the parts.  When I collected the vehicle ($70.40 later) they would not give me the report as "they had to check something on it, we'll e-mail it to you and post the copy". As it was I was in a hurry I accepted this and left.  They e-mailed it a few minutes after I left by the time on the e-mail. Below the result;Customer advised the transfer case was previously replaced and holden are requesting a dealership to look at it and possibly take pictures Taken photos of transfer case. Could not diagnose due to the condition of the transfer case i.e rust, and corrosion. Transfer case should have been left it vehicle for correct diagnoses to have taken place. Photos have been sent to holden for further communication with customer.I have requested copies of the alleged photos twice in person at the dealership and by e-mail to the dealer and Holden Customer Care without success to date. This is despite a personal undertaking by the Holden brand manager. I suspect the service department told him to "Buzz off" or words to that effect. He is a decent bloke despite who he works for.I was contacted by Holden Customer Care who told me they would do nothing for me and then told me they had shown the photos I had sent them to their experts and then repeated the above comment from the dealer almost word perfect. I was asked why didn't I bring the vehicle to the dealer when it failed. I replied, why would I pay about $180/hour that they charge, (estimated $2,000 plus) when I can do the job in my own workshop?? I also said I had no faith in the quality of the workmanship coming from the dealer workshop. The question is do I try to fix the problems with the vehicle, do I sell it to someone I don't know, or do I run it until it dies completely and drop it off at a scrap yard ?? I don't believe there were any photo's taken and if there were they probably bear out what I have said about the problem.  I also feel that there has been some very careless dealing with the truth undertaken by some of the people involved or is it ducking for cover (I'm being polite).

The oil that came out was like a metal soup as all the missing teeth were ground into a powder suspended in the oil. My thought was that the hard-facing on the gear had failed ( if it was ever there), this thought was supported by some other mechanics as well. The smaller gear was largely undamaged.  This gave strength to the thought of faulty manufacture. I was lucky that there was a replacement transfer case in Australia, it was the ONLY one! It cost me $3,000 and took two weeks to come from down south. I also found I needed to replace a CV joint as it was on the way out and as I had it apart I replaced it. I bought a pair of Drive Shafts complete, (GM parts) from an after market supplier for about half the price I could get one shaft alone in Darwin.I took clear photo's of the failed gears and sent them to Holden Customer Care, as I and mechanics from other brand car dealerships considered this was a manufacturing failure. I was told by Holden Customer Care to take it to the local Holden dealer in Darwin (there's only one) so they could report on the condition of the gears. I contacted the dealer who demanded that I bring the vehicle in to them as well as the failed transfer case, why I don't know nor have I been told why. Also it had to be booked in as a job for which I was going to have to pay to have them look at it. As it was the wet season the failed transfer case got rained on and developed some surface rust on some of the parts.  When I collected the vehicle ($70.40 later) they would not give me the report as "they had to check something on it, we'll e-mail it to you and post the copy". As it was I was in a hurry I accepted this and left.  They e-mailed it a few minutes after I left by the time on the e-mail. Below the result;Customer advised the transfer case was previously replaced and holden are requesting a dealership to look at it and possibly take pictures Taken photos of transfer case. Could not diagnose due to the condition of the transfer case i.e rust, and corrosion. Transfer case should have been left it vehicle for correct diagnoses to have taken place. Photos have been sent to holden for further communication with customer.I have requested copies of the alleged photos twice in person at the dealership and by e-mail to the dealer and Holden Customer Care without success to date. This is despite a personal undertaking by the Holden brand manager. I suspect the service department told him to "Buzz off" or words to that effect. He is a decent bloke despite who he works for.I was contacted by Holden Customer Care who told me they would do nothing for me and then told me they had shown the photos I had sent them to their experts and then repeated the above comment from the dealer almost word perfect. I was asked why didn't I bring the vehicle to the dealer when it failed. I replied, why would I pay about $180/hour that they charge, (estimated $2,000 plus) when I can do the job in my own workshop?? I also said I had no faith in the quality of the workmanship coming from the dealer workshop. The question is do I try to fix the problems with the vehicle, do I sell it to someone I don't know, or do I run it until it dies completely and drop it off at a scrap yard ?? I don't believe there were any photo's taken and if there were they probably bear out what I have said about the problem.  I also feel that there has been some very careless dealing with the truth undertaken by some of the people involved or is it ducking for cover (I'm being polite).

Owned 2011 Captiva 7 LX top of the range SIDI 190kw with 6 speed Transmission.  Only good thing it looks great! Bought car second hand with 65,000kms. Transmission went at 98,000kms a long with transfer case. Holden replaced transmission due to launching a special program knowing that 6 speed transmissions are poorly designed. If we were not covered it would of cost us over $9000 to fix. This special coverage program will only cover for 5 years 150,000kms. So if you are one of the unlucky people who own one after 2016 you are sitting on a time bomb.  Very annoying that such a nice looking vehicle inside and out was so poorly made.  When we got ours back there was a long line up of the same vehicles at service department.  Also catylac converters go engine light was always coming on door handles break. Very heavy on fuel ours was using 14.1 liters per 100kms.  Please save your money and buy anything but a CRAPTIVA.

I cautionally purchased the 2013 captiva lx nearly 5 yrs ago brand new after hearing concerns about the earlier model. However, my car has been prefect - touch wood.  The only thing that happened was last year the turbo outlet pipe split and I lost power.  An easy fix and car back to normal.  The car has all the bells and whistles for a cheap diesel 7 seater.  I had a medium entry ford tertitory which had heaps of problems and costs alot more than a territory.  The captiva in power mode has plently of power and the open road has good passing power.  My version of the 'craptiva' is all good and will be buying another one soon.

We purchased a manual petrol Captiva in 2014. We purchased the manual because we have been teaching our children to drive and we wanted them to be able to drive a manual vehicle even though most vehicles are automatic - this has been invaluable as our oldest daughter found when she got her fist job! The gears were quite clunky initially and having multiple drivers only made that issue worse but as the kids have left home and it's now mainly driven by one person it runs much more smoothly. It was all explained to me at the Holden dealership where we bought the car as to why this was happening - something to do with the computer recognising each driver and adjusting to the way they drive - in short our car was probably getting a bit confused!! (That's my version of their explanation as it made sense to me!!). We did have an issue for quite a few months between 20,000 and 30,000 kms - the car would be difficult to start, We would go shopping and after about the third stop and start we would have issues - we would always end up being able to get it to go but sometimes it would take about 5 attempts. The Holden dealership where we bought the car were unable to identify the problem but they were very good at trying to see what was happening. They mystery deepens a bit as this year this issue appears to have resolved itself although there have been a couple of instances when the car has appeared to nearly lose power when in traffic etc. which is a bit concerning. Overall it is a great little car - it's nothing flash but it gets us to where we need to be. I like the fact that it sits me up a bit higher which is handy in car parks when parked next to all those massive 4WD vehicles.

First hand Captiva 7 Active with a capped service price. Very reliable and comfortable for short strips around 400 - 500km per trip. Having an extra 2 back seats is an asset whenever you have extra kids on board. Easy to fill once middle seats are flat. Enjoy the cruise control which reduces the running cost of fuel in long routes.
