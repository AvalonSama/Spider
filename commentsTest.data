Have owned the captiva for a year now, had not missed a beat. Comfy seats!!!  Economical. Fits all our gear for a week away, including our two dogs!! The boot is well equipped will places to hook strechy straps to hold your shopping in place for a not squashed trip home.The sound system is ok too
The captivas are amazing.we just love it .It has everything you need plus more.Goes great no problems.has a lot of power. Steering is great .good fuel consumption. looks very classy inside and out.we cant talk our car up enough.Its a shame there now obsolete and it's a shame to hear all the negativity on the captivas.theres mixed reviews on every car you Google. Give the captivas a break there truly great cars with all the extras at a lower cost compared to other new SUVs
I purchased this car in 2013 and I'm still paying it off. Its been nothing but useless for my family. I have gotten in many life threatening accidents due to this crappy car and would never purchase anything under the name of holden again. The workers were extremely rude and definitely used me as i payed  50,000+ while i had it. My kids hated it sooo much they lied and said they had a ferrari. that tells you something!
Brought the car 6 weeks ago. Got half way to Sydney from Maitland got stranded on the side of the m1 with my 3 kids. DPF light came on quickly followed by the engine light, over heated and started smoking... we were in perfect driving conditions for it to do a regen but for some reason it didn’t.. Turns out the turbo has been spitting oil into the air intake 
We purchased a Captiva 5 new in 2013 with the 2.4lt petrol and 6spd manual just as a means of transport for the wife to use daily to travel to work.Overall it was ok and we never experienced any faults with the car in the 5yrs and 53,000klms of ownership however the 2.4l 4cyl engine is very underpowered and at hwy spds it struggled on big hills.Fuel consumption avg was 8.5l/100 on a hwy run and always sat around 12.5-13l/100klm in city traffic which is terrible for a 4cyl.Overall it was a very comfortable car to travel in but they are basic and the fit and finish is avg.The worse was yet to come when we decided to sell it recently for an automatic car. The service history was up to date and the car was still like new inside and out as I am very particular when looking after them and we still struggled to sell it and only managed to recoup 25% of what we paid for it 5 years earlier. It appears their reputation had caught up with it and we practically had to give it away to offload it. Buyer beware!
so this car has been really got spite the fuel, but the other day i had a bad encounter. my son was crying in the back so iv gorn and parked the car put it in park left key on got out to attend to him in the back.. all of a sudden the car started to move..... iv pannicked ran to the front and grabbed the wheel turned it quickly before going into on comming traffic.. and hit a parked car. i took to the mechanics and no faults showed. why has this happened what can I do?
Bought Captiva Active 7 seater  on May  First trip was from Melbourne to Sydney and Return. 7 People were  there on the trip (3 kids).  Though we had problem with the luggage space, but the  ride was really good. Economy of average 11L/100KM for overall trip  we got.This car was really cheap in initial price compared to its competitors.  Leather seat,  Sun roof are included in the value. Android /Apple Auto is really a add on  feature. The  A/C vent in the last row make sure that the kids are kept in right temperature. Zone climate control is really a good feature.   Good reversing camera add value to the car.
Have bought a Captiva despite its reputation and after doing my homework. Love this car! It’s comfortable and great value. Leather seats, good sound system, easy to use 7 seven. Just a great functional family car and so far so good with Holden servicing. Courtesy car and free coffee and capped price.
I have the Holden Captiva Active 7 seat SUV and its been nothing but trouble. We purchased it brand new in 2017 and so far we have had sunroof electronics fail, and the rubber deteriorate. The clock spring needed replacing as the complete front dash lights were flickering. The two front wheel bearings needed replacement as well. All this with only 16,000km on the odo and being purchased and only serviced at Holden. I have also been told by Holden mechanics the Diesels are even worse and to steer clear.
My Captiva 2014 had timing belt snapped in 2018 despite just having 60 K on the clock. I took it to Holden and even though warranty was finished a year and so ago and I was the third owner, they installed a brand new engine on it that they had to manufacture in Korea and ship to Australia. For the time that the car was under repair, I had 2018 top of the range Captiva LTZ turbo diesel as courtesy car that I enjoyed driving more than my original car. Luckily, I did not have to pay a cent for the work done on my car. I don't claim that it was stress free process but excellent customer service at Sutton City Roseberry made it as bareable as possible for me. I really appreciate these guys care and professionalism.
I bought a golden captiva after 2.5 years start to make noise from suspension I went back to dealer.I been told that they changed the suspension should be problem after six months same problem Now warranty is finish.After warranty expire now other thing computer screen showing engine problem i been to mechanic He told me to change the rear sensor detectors.Its only 4 year old car and only 600xx kms done
I have found that the newer models of the Holden Captiva are highly reliable and mechanically sound compared to the earlier models 2010/2011 which have had well known problems associated with them, they are fuel efficient and very roomy big boot space and a great family car have take my car interstate maybe 8 times and has been great for every drive.
Had Captiva for 4 years we’ve done 50000 on top of the 140000 it had on it when purchased, only just spent money on it recently for just the usual wear and tear. Great car runs well interior is very nice, done many long trips without any issues, reliable car.
We purchased a 2010 Holden Captiva for our family. We have only done 147,000kms to date and I have had to pay more than $5000 in repairs to parts above the normal servicing and maintaining. Issues include, keys getting stuck in ignition causing gear box needing replacing, aircon not working and will cost more than $2k to get fixed due to part completely missing from under bonnet. The radio does not automatically turn off anymore, the door beeps when open even though the lights are turned off, Car does not lock with buttons on keys any longer. All these problems are not "easy fix" small problems. They are all LARGE expensive fixes that I can no longer afford. Quoted by Holden it would cost me a further $7000 to get my car back to a good condition.
Ive bought a 2007 captiva, the biggest reason at the beginning is cause my partner loves holden cars.But man, this is one of the worse car we've drove, air conditioning never cool enough, problems after problems, fixing it costed us a bloody fortune. And we finally bought a new car and that will never be another holden car for us again
Very smooth on the road, no noise at all, great handling. 7 seater is great can't complain really. Tailor to amount of people or space needed in boot. Plenty of leg Room. Comfortable to travel in. 6 cd stacker. The fuel usage isn't too bad, it's about 11L/100km. Reliable car for a growing family.
I would like to know if anyone has any issues with  Holden Captiva LTZ (7seater) 2016 model, please let me know what your issues are and what was the outcome and if it’s ongoing and have you contacted Holden Customer Care and what was your experience?  I’ve got huge problems and all I get told is our diagnosis can’t find any issues and this is a replacement vehicle. The car is dangerous and should not be on the roads and still Holden Customer Care keep asking me to take it back to the Holden Service which has bee done numerous times with no outcome I’m taking it further to VACT as advised by Consumers Affaires Victoria and was advised that I get on here as well before making an application as these cars shouldn’t be sold if they have all these issues
Bought a brand new Holden Crrraptiva in 2010. Just over 7 years old, had oil leak.Took to the Holden  dealer,  got a quote of 3400$ to fix it. This a major issue with all Holden Captiva and they don't bother about fixing or recalling the carsHolden probably give some extras compared to other Japanese cars, don't fall for the trap.Never ever buy Holdens.
Pretty much everything about car is good, ample legroom front and back. 7 seat option, sunroof, gives roughly 15 ltr/100km petrol consumption in city. Leather seats , android auto and apple play included. Reversing camera and daytime LEDs gives fine touch. Power cigratte socket in boot with aircon vents for 7 seat configuration.
I just love my brand new Captiva.  I runs so quiet, it smells great with the leather interier.  It drives so smooth.  Has a clear reverse camera. Its easy enough to work out all of its extras.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I go extras added to mine but it looks beautiful.
I absolutely love my Holden Captiva lx. Brand New straight off the showroom floor. Love the leg room compared to other cars I've driven.  It's been very economical whether it's long distance or just running around town. Handles well very light steering  for a medium suv. Very little road noise. This car has taken everything we've thrown in it. 7 seater so plenty of room for the family. Wouldn't trade it for the world.
Only good thing is when car is running it handles well on the road.And its ashame its a nice looking car. MECHANICAL WISE NIGHTMARE. Interior problems as well things come loose broken driver side seat frame snapped. Glove box came apart .But thats the least of the problems this car has.
Brought new in 2011, Holden Captiva has only 73 000kms on the clock. So many things have gone wrong. The dash clock resets itself to 1:00 every time you turn the car on. Will cost over $2000 to get fixed. Shock absorbers and now the transmission need replacing. Over $8000 in repairs. Will NEVER buy another Holden.
We bought our 2012 glx diesel captiva brand new and have had continuous problems with it. The motor has been taken out 6 times now. It has been served religiously and at 130,000 kms it now has over $7000 just in parts (not including labour) to repair the auto transmission amongst a bunch of other things. We paid $55,000 which is pretty much money down the toilet now as it’s worth nothing within 6 short years. We have had to pay extra at each servicing for several things like broken bearings, door handles, reverse screen etc. the lady at our servicing Centre laughed and said it’s not worth fixing and to have a nice weekend. Thanks a lot Holden. We will never buy from you ever again.
In Oct. 2017 at about 104,000Km's the transfer case failed and was out of warranty. Upon removing it I found the larger of the two gears that send power to the rear wheels had lost all its teeth. The oil that came out was like a metal soup as all the missing teeth were ground into a powder suspended in the oil. My thought was that the hard-facing on the gear had failed ( if it was ever there), this thought was supported by some other mechanics as well. The smaller gear was largely undamaged.  This gave strength to the thought of faulty manufacture. I was lucky that there was a replacement transfer case in Australia, it was the ONLY one! It cost me $3,000 and took two weeks to come from down south. I also found I needed to replace a CV joint as it was on the way out and as I had it apart I replaced it. I bought a pair of Drive Shafts complete, (GM parts) from an after market supplier for about half the price I could get one shaft alone in Darwin.I took clear photo's of the failed gears and sent them to Holden Customer Care, as I and mechanics from other brand car dealerships considered this was a manufacturing failure. I was told by Holden Customer Care to take it to the local Holden dealer in Darwin (there's only one) so they could report on the condition of the gears. I contacted the dealer who demanded that I bring the vehicle in to them as well as the failed transfer case, why I don't know nor have I been told why. Also it had to be booked in as a job for which I was going to have to pay to have them look at it. As it was the wet season the failed transfer case got rained on and developed some surface rust on some of the parts.  When I collected the vehicle ($70.40 later) they would not give me the report as "they had to check something on it, we'll e-mail it to you and post the copy". As it was I was in a hurry I accepted this and left.  They e-mailed it a few minutes after I left by the time on the e-mail. Below the result;Customer advised the transfer case was previously replaced and holden are requesting a dealership to look at it and possibly take pictures Taken photos of transfer case. Could not diagnose due to the condition of the transfer case i.e rust, and corrosion. Transfer case should have been left it vehicle for correct diagnoses to have taken place. Photos have been sent to holden for further communication with customer.I have requested copies of the alleged photos twice in person at the dealership and by e-mail to the dealer and Holden Customer Care without success to date. This is despite a personal undertaking by the Holden brand manager. I suspect the service department told him to "Buzz off" or words to that effect. He is a decent bloke despite who he works for.I was contacted by Holden Customer Care who told me they would do nothing for me and then told me they had shown the photos I had sent them to their experts and then repeated the above comment from the dealer almost word perfect. I was asked why didn't I bring the vehicle to the dealer when it failed. I replied, why would I pay about $180/hour that they charge, (estimated $2,000 plus) when I can do the job in my own workshop?? I also said I had no faith in the quality of the workmanship coming from the dealer workshop. The question is do I try to fix the problems with the vehicle, do I sell it to someone I don't know, or do I run it until it dies completely and drop it off at a scrap yard ?? I don't believe there were any photo's taken and if there were they probably bear out what I have said about the problem.  I also feel that there has been some very careless dealing with the truth undertaken by some of the people involved or is it ducking for cover (I'm being polite).
Owned 2011 Captiva 7 LX top of the range SIDI 190kw with 6 speed Transmission.  Only good thing it looks great! Bought car second hand with 65,000kms. Transmission went at 98,000kms a long with transfer case. Holden replaced transmission due to launching a special program knowing that 6 speed transmissions are poorly designed. If we were not covered it would of cost us over $9000 to fix. This special coverage program will only cover for 5 years 150,000kms. So if you are one of the unlucky people who own one after 2016 you are sitting on a time bomb.  Very annoying that such a nice looking vehicle inside and out was so poorly made.  When we got ours back there was a long line up of the same vehicles at service department.  Also catylac converters go engine light was always coming on door handles break. Very heavy on fuel ours was using 14.1 liters per 100kms.  Please save your money and buy anything but a CRAPTIVA.
I cautionally purchased the 2013 captiva lx nearly 5 yrs ago brand new after hearing concerns about the earlier model. However, my car has been prefect - touch wood.  The only thing that happened was last year the turbo outlet pipe split and I lost power.  An easy fix and car back to normal.  The car has all the bells and whistles for a cheap diesel 7 seater.  I had a medium entry ford tertitory which had heaps of problems and costs alot more than a territory.  The captiva in power mode has plently of power and the open road has good passing power.  My version of the 'craptiva' is all good and will be buying another one soon.
We purchased a manual petrol Captiva in 2014. We purchased the manual because we have been teaching our children to drive and we wanted them to be able to drive a manual vehicle even though most vehicles are automatic - this has been invaluable as our oldest daughter found when she got her fist job! The gears were quite clunky initially and having multiple drivers only made that issue worse but as the kids have left home and it's now mainly driven by one person it runs much more smoothly. It was all explained to me at the Holden dealership where we bought the car as to why this was happening - something to do with the computer recognising each driver and adjusting to the way they drive - in short our car was probably getting a bit confused!! (That's my version of their explanation as it made sense to me!!). We did have an issue for quite a few months between 20,000 and 30,000 kms - the car would be difficult to start, We would go shopping and after about the third stop and start we would have issues - we would always end up being able to get it to go but sometimes it would take about 5 attempts. The Holden dealership where we bought the car were unable to identify the problem but they were very good at trying to see what was happening. They mystery deepens a bit as this year this issue appears to have resolved itself although there have been a couple of instances when the car has appeared to nearly lose power when in traffic etc. which is a bit concerning. Overall it is a great little car - it's nothing flash but it gets us to where we need to be. I like the fact that it sits me up a bit higher which is handy in car parks when parked next to all those massive 4WD vehicles.
First hand Captiva 7 Active with a capped service price. Very reliable and comfortable for short strips around 400 - 500km per trip. Having an extra 2 back seats is an asset whenever you have extra kids on board. Easy to fill once middle seats are flat. Enjoy the cruise control which reduces the running cost of fuel in long routes.
Driving experience is ok, the seats are quite rigid and the leather is not very soft. Suspension is rough. This cR has been subject to some major warranty claims within its first two years of life and the servicing cost for this car (Captiva 7 LX DIESEL) is skyyyyyyyy high!
We purchased our 2nd hand captiva in 2016 and had issues with it before even leaving the dealer.Air bag light came on during test drive and they found the alternator needed replacement  then on the drive home  oil pump died and had to be towed. Engine light continually coming on and costing us heaps each time, fuel pump died we wish we never had brought it have spent enough on it to buy a new car
You know what, I had to sell my car for dirt cheap as I just couldn't get it fix completely and ever since I got Holden, I had nothing but problems. There is a major issue with all Holden is that the engine lights are always on and its a major issue, nothing wrong with the engine but it just comes up. I took it to Holden twice, they fixed it, charged me $800 each time and it comes up again.
We have a 2012 model Captiva 7 SX diesel, bought new in early 2013.We have had our share of problems, but overall, it hasn’t been the disaster that others have experienced. And when compared to other cars (Ford Rangers come to mind), it really hasn’t been that bad.As a car, it drives well, but don’t expect to carry anyone over 4 foot tall in the 3rd row.  But for a young family they are fine. 2 child seats fit in the 2nd row fine. Air conditioning is not the most efficient, and the 2nd row has only a tiny amount of air flow under the front seats. The 3rd row gets nothing. But for the occasional use as a 7 seater, it will get you by. Plenty of room in the front for tall adults. Reasonable on fuel, and will get 35 mpg on the highway without trying, and pretty good around town too. Boot space is OK, but obviously only if the 3rd row seats are folded down. Visibility is good. Easy to park and easy to drive. Plenty of power as well.Most of the problems we had were under warranty, and I would suggest that by far the biggest issue is the service offered by Holden Dealers. Problems we have had were:Air conditioning didn’t work 2 days after we bought it. Ours was one of the first to play up, so the dealers took a while to solve it. Was a simple reflash of the PCM to fix. Driver’s seat belt started to fray early and this too was replaced under warranty. The DPF failed to regenerate, and the dealer had to force a clean. It does seem to need regenerating fairly frequently but this can be partly due to what quality of fuel you use. Engine had an oil leak, which meant the engine had to be removed to repair it, but this too was under warranty.Starter motor wiring – this was a Clayton’s recall by Holden - they only fixed it if the car broke down. They didn’t fix the issue properly on our car though and we had to revisit this at our own expense.If someone was to buy one, I would recommend the lower spec models, as they have less electronics to fail or go wrong. The 15000 km oil change interval is a bit of a stretch, so if you’re capable, do an oil change every 7500 kms and the engine will be better for it. Get a transmission oil change as well at some stage. That oil doesn’t last forever. And steer clear of cheaper branded fuels.At around the 80000 to 100000 km mark, get the intercooler hose to the throttle body replaced before it fails. And get an auto electrician to fit a decent earth lug on the main earth wire from the battery to the engine block and clean the connection. This is one of the causes of the battery light coming on. Do this and you should have a reasonable run.Expect to have to replace rear shocks and possibly front control arm bushes before 100000kms. Keep an eye on the brake master cylinder for leaks too.But for what they cost new, it does the job.
This car has broken down on me 5 times in the 3 years we have owned it since new. Both the grab handles in the front passenger seat and the rear drivers side seat have been broken from people holding onto them. And not even holding on hard!!! The build is terrible the quality is garbage. I would never buy another holden ever again.
Holden Captiva CG 2007 CX Model Diesel hands down one of the best SUV s to purchase for comfort,economy an shear grunt very stealth acceleration, keep an eye on our odometer as you will constantly be over the speed limit , the turbo is very smooth, transmission good, overall 8 out 10 for this Vehicle
overall have been happy with car to date ,came with 5 year wty,  55.000 km   front end has to be removed  control arm bushings worn out at 55.000kmcovered by warranty  if you buy one out of warranty id be visiting pedders  , live and learn they used poor quality rubber bushings,   battery died at 24months and all four tyres required replacement also at 55000km   no other issues to date,
My current captiva is the second one I've owned. Had a 2012 Diesel 7 and now have a 2015 petrol 5. Both cars do exactly what was expected of them. Our current captiva 5 is used for short trips and is comfortable, versatile and very reliable. No complaints at all!
Have had my captiva for 4 years has really nothing done until now. Heater has gone on it and back seat left side  doesnt transform down. Been advice to take to Holden dealership just to assess it would cost  that's not including parts or labour. The cost would be ?
Had my 2010 Captiva for 8 years and I am about to upgrade to a brand new one. I love it. The price for what you get is the major selling point for me. Have never had an issue. I have the diesel and my car has now done almost 200,000kms, hence the need for an upgrade.
Hi i have a hole in my transmission my mechanic has asked me to replace it, very hard to get it.I found one but its 7 seater mine is 5 seaterthe model is same 2011 captiva 2.2 diesel awd So will it fit in my car. please help
I had this car for three years and it was good to drive .  I had the diesel one and it was good on fuel. I bought with the sun roof option and the side steps option . It was good . I did not have any issues until i sell it.
Bloody Terrific to drive, comfortable, fuel efficient (Diesel), has all the gadgets, great all round vision, cold air conditioner and hot heater, runs smoother than most diesels and exceptionally quiet.Oil Service Due light impossible to reset without a scanner as Holden have blocked the manual procedure in Australian diesels.Great Car.
The 7 seater Captiva is an amazing family car and has a lot of space, never had a problem with the car and has never broken down on me. Looks good, very comfortable in long drives and very smooth. I read many bad reviews about the car but my friend recommended it for a family car and we love it.
At first we were scared to purchase a captiva, all the bad reviews, what people have said 'craptiva' etc... I have friends who have purchased a captiva and have had no problems and recommended it. I was against it, but the wife loved it and we got ourselves a craptiva 2012 LX, top of the range. The sales person said pre 2012 were the issues; I hope they were right. Recommend the diesel, tried the petrol no guts, diesel has the power, just make sure to service every 6 months being diesel. Leather seats, 7 seats, blue tooth, heated seats, air con is great, built in nav man, sun roof. Enjoy the ride, fingers crossed.
Worst decision purchasing Captiva. Very poor quality cars, money pit, air conditioning for 7 seater is great for the front seat people the middle row have their vents under the front seat so their feet get air however their faces don’t and the third row no vents at all and no ventilation.  No boot space the only thing that looks good is the outside of the car but that works out to be a pretty expensive if you are only buying for the looks
The CRAPTIVA where to start 4 years old, yes I love the interior style love the outside I'm thinking the shell is the only thing good about this car oh and the colour, the rest total crap box lemon!! feels like it doesn't kick into gear properly sometimes taking off from a hill on to a main road with high speed traffic was scary as it doesn't take off smoothly or change gears but by the time it does cars are up your backside nearly hitting the back of your car, loose steering, timing chain stretched need a new one engine light is on, sounds like a truck when you start it, Metal in the oil filter.The car turned itself off I mean completely! on the road all power to the car stopped with no warning it nearly caused a pileup even the steering locked up pretty scary when you have 5 kids two infents in the car and they could have died.Own it for 2 years before problems started mechanic laughed at us when we had it serviced saying you should have shopped around its the worst car nothing but problems and that they make a lot of money of people coming to them with ongoing problems most are engine and timing chains. It was shattering as we still have 18,000 to pay off a car that is sitting in a drive way brought as a PEOPLE MOVER for a family of 7 not mentioning the lack of space once the seats are up we couldn't take anything but a small bag each on holiday crammed under kids feet uncomfortable trips with squashed kids and no pram space anywhere not happy at all I just wanted something cheap with space for a family and was conned by salesman that it was a great car for the price and a people mover and that was a lie!!! I believe yes I got what I paid for cheap crappy car with noting but problems and still paying for it, unless you have an extra 15,000 for ongoing problems and to replace that main thing a car needs like engine I suggest you don't buy its lemon!!! try the Hyundai Santa Fe I've researched and that seems to be one of the family size cars that hasn't had reported problems. Anyway totally devastated please don't make that same mistake I did if you have children and more the 2-3 and need room its not the car for you!! Don't listen to sales pitch listen to yourself and think of the safety of your family this car is a budget car and you can't put a price on your family pay a little more to know there safe and your car will last.
Enjoyed the car for the first 3 or 4 years. Now ? What an expensive waste of time and effort. Absolutely feel ripped off. Numerous and constant expensive faults. ABS, turbo, alternater, starter motor,  central locking,, particular filter etc etc etc. Only driven 92k km and ready for the scrap heap. My  wife refuses to have anything to do with it. Unsafe and unreliable
At the end of the day the Captiva is a good car, looked after and service properly, this car is both compact on the outside with ample room on the inside with so many options and top of the range LX having a leather interior it's luxury at a affordable price
Disgusted in this vehicle, Holden support shameful, customer service abysmal and reputation management non existent. I had our Captiva from new, serviced at every interval by Holden (OEM) and still the list is long of failures and repairs carried out by Holden:1. Seized/Polled starter motor - Replaced ($950) OEM Warranty2. Main window control module failed - Replaced ($350) OEM Warranty3. Lower Steering Linkages self loosened -  Repaired ($250) Owner4. Wheel alignment out from new QTY 4 tyres scrubbed - Replaced ($650) Owner 5. QTY Diesel Injectors Failed -  Replaced ($2400) OEM Warranty6. Main wiring Loom and anti knock sensors failed - Replaced ($2500) Swan insurance Warranty7. Within a month of the previous failure ECM Module fried by Exhaust Temp Sensor  - Replaced ($2500) Owner as Holden referred this failure to fair wear and tear. Please beware of any Holden Vehicle including the new Equinox (Rebadged Craptiva) as I wouldn't be surprised if it too is manufactured by Daewoo. Luckily we hadn't had a transmission failure but on sold this bucket and now have purchased a Mitsubishi Pajero Sport  .......Great Car and 4X4.....Craptiva's are an unknown and can't be trusted likewise for Holden Australia......Shame on you Holden........!
I like the style of it and holden has a good reputation. Looks alot more expensive than it is. Good performance for the price point. Interior is nice, no plastic looking rubbish dashboard, but nothing fancy eaither. One thing is dislike is there are no air conditioner or heater vents for the kids in the rear, and on a very hot day they are boiling, until the whole car cools down. Besides that, never had a problem with it and we drive it alot.
I had read mixed reviews about the Captiva when I was looking to purchase one in 2016 but I test drove one and decided I would buy it anyway. I'm so glad I did. It is a great car that drives beautifully.It is spacious inside without being too bulky outside. In saying that Im not very tall so I don't know how other people may find it. The boot space is great and I find that it fits a lot in there. I am not able to put the seats down anymore with two child car seats but if you're able to, it feels more like a small van and can move quite a lot. I like that there is an eco function which means it uses less petrol and has a less power. It wouldn't be a good setting to use if you are going off road or needing a lot of power but for driving around the suburbs and into the city I find having eco on is perfect. Filling up the tank costs between $60 - $75 depending on the price but I find that reasonable for a SUV. Its a reliable car thats lovely to drive, especially long distances. The only thing Id like would be a bit more technology like blind spot alerts but I would assume the new models after 2016 would have this. I can't recommend this car enough, especially for the price!
Very versatile and multipurposeful vehicle which is great for family use. Perhaps best feature of this car, particularly when discussing the family practicality of it, are the two flip out seats in the boot, which are useful when having to taxi children. However, if car only to be used by one or two, definitely go for a smaller vehicle to save space, petrol and fuel emissions.
Sold an old Sedan and bought an used Captiva Lx 2013 in Jan. So far my observation has been ..Performance: Good pick-up, Steering Control and Cruise Control. Fuel Economy: 13.5L/100Km... Not so good.Safety and comfort: ExcellentNosie: Noisy Engine, otherwise all good!Dashboard and Leather seating (heated first row) is premium like
I've got an SX Diesel that's just clocked 150k and about to turn 5 years old. The initial years have been OK, with services every 6 months - which correlates pretty much to 15k on the odometer. Apart from one wiring issue that was dealt with as a warranty claim (including a tow, as the car wouldn't start when calling in at the local servo).This Christmas we broke down on the road home from visiting relatives - the car was running but refused to go into gear. Once again this required roadside rescue and an expensive tow. But no warranty for this failure.When the service guys looked at it they advised that it's the auto transmission that's failed and it's cheaper to replace than repair as "GM know they have a problem and offer the replacements at a discount". However this discounted replacement cost over $5k with labour and consumables included.I'm not happy that with a properly serviced vehicle that has mostly done hot running and very little towing - I have a motorbike trailer which we take out on the odd weekend, but that's all the towing it's done - it's having such as significant transmission failure that's seen me $5k out of pocket.
Bought the Captiva 4 months ago and so far it has ran smoothly. Has an appealing look from the outside, however you might find that the inside lacks space if you're 6 feet tall like me. That is one of the very few things I don't like about the car. The engine creates a bit of noise so it's not quiet, but it handles well especially in wet conditions. Uses fuel up quite a bit, but overall it's worth the cost.
We bought our car 4 months ago. The features are great for the value, except the in car GPS is quite difficult to use. 8.5 litres per 100 kilometers which is good. Only has air conditioning vents in the front though.  Reliability so far has been good and the car drives well.
Bought My Car In July 16 Not Even 6 Months Later It Had Several Lights On In The Dashboard. Had It Put In A Mechanic $1700 Later Thought The Car Would Be Running Better Nope My Car Started To Jerk In First Gear Stopped Driving My Car Went To Drive It A Few Weeks Later And Started The Car Put It In Drive And My Car Just Reeved Out.
I bought this car as a family car, and though we are three in the family we needed something when going away on holidays. This car has been excellent so far. The primary use is around town and it works well for my wife to store the stroller and other items in the back (with the last two seats down there is plenty of storage)i have driven the car from melbourne to Canberra numerous times and even towed a racecar for a friend once. The captiva performed as expected and there were no surprises. I normally drive the car on ECO mode and that causes it to take off slowly when you leave the lights. However i got used to it after some time (having come off a 277KW Honda Accord previously) and i can switch it off if I need to overtake. My wife prefers ECO mode as there are no sudden jerks for our daughter in her car seat while starting and stopping.I went to Canberra via the Great Alpine road with my family and was really surprised how the fully loaded car climbed inclines without breaking a sweat. We recently just took the car on the ferry to Tasmania for a week and had absolutely no issues. I fill it with all types of diesel - BP, APCO, 7-Eleven and other independent fuels and it doesnt seem to matter to the performance. Fuel consumption is 10lt/100Km in normal driving and 7-8lt/100kms when doing long drives.I have read negative reviews from Car magazines who dont rate it highly, but i reckon they are spoiled by the ability to get expensive brands for review and that biases them towards the Merc/Toyota/Kia's etc which are much more expensive for a top of the range car. For the 36000 I paid for the diesel car, I am very happy with it. I also added 2k of Tint + interior and exterior protection. The tint is fantastic and I have noticed that it cuts a huge amount of UV which really helps on hot days. Exterior protection is amazing - cleaning the car is a breeze and even after 2.5 yrs the car has a new car shine. bird poo just washes off under water.Interior protection - havent found any difference to commentno issues with the car and it did come with 3 year free servicing so I havent spent a cent in maintenance so far.
Very nice design. The car looks pretty good from outside.The car drives really nice on the road. Its very quite and the handling is good on the curves and wet roads.The interior doesn't look very luxurious but that's ok considering the price of the car. I really like the carplay entertainment system.Fuel economy is not the best and that is one of the things I don't like about this car. The car performance is good for urban driving. I haven't had the opportunity yet to test on long drives.
Non stop problems with this car and poor servicing from Holden dealerships. Each time I service my vehicle there is something wrong and parts need to be replaced. Always rattles and basically falls apart once you hit 100 000. Fail Holden you need to get your act together and service departments as well
It's very good car I like my options and sunruf leather radio navigation system  camera when someone trying to run away from police and all of the things it's on it but it is very very comfortable  to drive and very quite on the road lots of space in back and boot
I've read a number of the reviews and not sure if we got lucky with our car but we have been very happy with it. It was a somewhat reluctant purchase, replacing what was my dream car due to changing needs and a new camper trailer to tow. The car has been able to stand up to everything that we have given it. It's even done a small amount of off road work on my brothers property. It's not without faults, but these are pretty minor and things I put down to the price point of the car. The SatNav is garbage. It will get you there but will never take the most direct route. Holden told me there are no new maps available which seems to be ridiculous given the car is less than 2 years old. Climate control is non existent as well. Holden told me there is nothing wrong because it cools and heats, they don't get the concept of climate control them. If I set the temp to 22 degrees that is what I would expect. While the aircon works fine, you have to ignore the temperature settings and keep turning it up or down until you get a good temperature in the car.It's quite thirsty, but replaced a V8 so it's heaps better than the old car.It handles well for a car of it's size and is a nice car to drive. It's a good tow vehicle and has great limits for it's class of car. We're looking at trading in for a 4WD and it's only now that we see some of the really good features that just are not available in the bigger cars. The two that come to mind most are the finish and layout of the storage boxes in the boot area and the fact that the passenger seat folds down flat to allow for very long loads to be transported within the car. I can easily fit my son's 3m kayak in with the seats down. Not many cars that can do that.
Car looked and run like brand new, got it at 58,000km. Then 3 months later with only 2000km, my Holden Captiva cx 2012 was running but couldn't move. Now have to fork out $4000 for a new transfer box installed, well done Holden, for screwing us all.not the same any more tisk tisk.
Holden need a class action Brought against them. Hey had my car for months and still it's no better. It needs a turbo and a gear box at least. The failed to carry out a safety recall, but told us other wise and our car caught fire. If anyone can help me with a case, comment.
In all honesty. The car is good for family trips. Some models have on roof screens which is great for the kids but some don't. Some are 7 seats which is great if the kids want to bring along a friend or 2. Only thing is when the 2 rear seats are put up it doesn't leave much space. Car lasts for around 500kms on a diesel tank.
I bought my car brand new from Bartons Holden in Bayside. From the start the car had problems. Rattles, oil leaks, starter failure, rear shock absorbers, etc. The engine had to be removed twice. Once for the rear oil seal and the second time the crankcase was leaking.Now at 121000k's the transfer case has failed. Major cracks on the housing and oil leaking out. This is truly a lemon.Do not expect to buy a brand new car, service it regularly and have this level of failures on the car.We are being ripped off for being good loyal customers.These cars are cheap to buy but has endless problems no matter how well you look after and maintain it.Very disappointed. That is the last Holden I will ever buy.
We bought our Holden Captiva with under 10,000km on the clock, demo model.  Should have taken more notice of the reviews.  It is quite a nice looking car but the trims around the wheels and at the front and back are now extremely faded, after quite a short time.  Since owning the car we have had quite a few problems.  At one stage whilst driving the car it would just slow down with no warning, like the brakes had been applied, quite dangerous when you are on the road.  We took it to the dealership where we bought it from and they tried to tell us that we were driving with one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake at the same time, (when we said this was not the case) they tried to tell my husband that I must be doing it without realising (they then took it for a drive to realise that we weren't stupid)  They then said the computer indicated it needed a new part ($600 later, problem not fixed) my husband (who is not mechanically minded) asked them if they needed to recalibrate the brakes (this worked).  We then enquired as to why they replaced a part that it didn't need, they said it still was needed and we could not prove that this was not the case.  Four months ago the car just wouldn't start after driving to work. Starter motor had gone - another $1,200 to be spent on it.  Three weeks ago whilst driving 3 hours to the city, stopped for a break, you guessed it, car wouldn't start - yes starter motor had gone again.  Apart from the inconvenience of waiting for RACV, trying to get a train to the city and get to where I needed to be (only about 4 hours late), the car had to be towed to nearest Holden dealer, no car for the next five days, it was an hour and a half drive to pick the car up after being repaired.  (Approx $1,500 this time, luckily it was under warranty).  The car is not bad to drive but anything that might be sitting on the seat will go flying when the brakes are applied or turning the corner, it is like the balance is out of whack.  Like I said,we will never purchase or recommend one again.  A family member was interested in buying this car from us but we won't do it - it would cause too much heartache and money for them in the end. I spoke to someone from the dealership we bought it from asking why the starter motor they replaced stopped working after only 4 months - they said we would get a phone call back to explain - this still has not happened.
Pretty responsive,handles well and is relatively quiet,the leather upholstery is not quite up to scratch and the GPS map is not very good .however I haven't had any issues  in the reliability stakes and running costs are acceptable. I would be happy to replace it with a new Captiva .
Slow to take off. Turbo issues continually even after being fixed. Cheap plastic feel inside.  Good seating position. Lots of boot space.  Three lap sash belts in the rear.  Legroom in front is fine but the back could have more space. Rear view mirrors reflect onto the windows annoyingly. Nice looking car.
I bought my 2012 Holden Captiva when it was nearly 3 years old. I had researched for half a year about my new exciting upgrade to fit my 3 kids in. It had only 50,000 on the clock and had been garaged and very well looked after. It looked brand new!  One day, less than 6 months of owning my new car, the transmission seized. Total transmission failure. While under warranty I did not have to pay the $10 G repair bill. However I expressed my disappointment to Holden, saying I was not very confident in a car that this could happen to so early on. Now, 2 years later, my engine has seized! Oil cooler broke so there is oil in the radiator. They say it is an internal part and even with my regular servicing, no one could have foreseen this disaster. Now I DO have to pay the $6,200 repair bill. I cannot believe it. I have 2 friends who also have suffered many breakdowns and repairs of their near new Captivas (who are happy to be named if needed). I believe Holden has NOT met consumer expectation and the required standard of a new to near new car. I have rung Holden expressing my disappointment in their product and have asked them to pay for the repair, as it clearly a fault in the car. Total LEMON of a car.January 6th 2018 Update: Crap Captiva RepairIts coming up to 4 weeks that Holden have had my Captiva which has a broken oil cooler. Its out of warranty but since this is the 2nd major fault in the near new car in 2 years, I have requested Holden to fix it at their expense. 4 weeks without a car, over christmas, with 3 kids. Someone at Holden needs to stand up, take responsibility and fix my car. No confidence in Crap Captiva.
What i dislike about my 2016 holden captiva 7 seats sunroof leather seats etc. Where do i start.I brought my car on the 25 oct 2016 and 6 mths later drivers side struts and bearings and then 5 months later the left side went had repaired finally 2 weeks ago now 13 months old and the drivers side is going again. In the town i love in there are no dirt roads and the speed limits are 40 and 50 all round town with only two short roads with 60. I will never recommend a holden captiva as it is nothing but a Holden CRAPTIVA
My wife wanted a poor mans SUV with 7 seats for the kids school run and whammo, the transmission failed in 6 weeks of driving and only 3,722km's travelled. Holden has said the transmission will take approximately 96 days to arrive from Korea and no loan car will be offered. Once received, the dealership needs about 10 days to install and test the new transmission. 4 months of rego and insurance will be lost whilst the car sits out the back of the dealership in the open air rusting away. I'm so glad we didn't trade in our older SUV !.
The new captiva are an amazing value they come leather and sunroof , cruise control . I bought mine an year ago Holden captiva active its 2.4 l but powerfull as well compare to others it’s 123kw @ 5600 rpm which quite quick even with family of four. Ok on fuel I m getting around 10.5 liters per 100 Kim’s Holden has given 7 yrs new car warranty for price of 26k . This is an bargain with capped price servicing for 270 covers all your maintanance cost. I would highly recommend this product. They have really done lots of improvements on the product.
Our Captiva LTZ diesel has been a great surprise, the 2.2 diesel is quiet and efficient. I'm pretty impressed with the handling and steering response. I love the leather interior, android auto, heated seats, mirrors and rear aircon controls. It's extremely large inside with my 6ft rower of a son very happy with the room in the back. Looks like the last of the Captiva's might be the best.
The Holden Captiva is a prime example of getting what you pay for.It is a cheap 7 seater so serves a purpose.  However, little things like no air conditioning vents in the back anywhere is a poor design for the Australian climate.Not bad but would spend more on a better car next time too.
Driving it is great handles the road very well for short to long distances. low noise level makes the driving experience better and cost to run it low to medium comfort is great  with plenty of leg room, with boot space ample overall a great car to own and drive
Been a cracker of a SUV since we bought it new ,  almost at 150000km on the clock and running like new, 2 issues over the years , fuels tank sensor and steering column which the Holden dealer in Frankston sorted, has been recalled a couple of times, one being for the rocker arm bearings. The outside trim plastics have faded over time , but the interior is still great and everything still seams solid , have done a couple of off road trips , nothing too serious. I rate this vehicle better than the Mitsubishi Pajero it replaces which had too many issues being a Japanese vehicle !
Great car. Seven seats are useful when you need them and fold away very easily and are good when you need the extra room. One down side is that there are no vents in the back of the car. With a small child it is hard to get them cool without putting the passenger seat down. It drives brilliantly and the tyres that came with the car lasted us 5 years. Fuel consumption isn't great but is ok.
After having my Captiva from new for the last 10 years I am very happy with it. Just returned from our 5th 5500 km Australia wide trip and have great confidence in the reliability of the car and even still returns an average fuel economy 8.5L / 100km on the highway fully loaded. The DPF (diesel particulate filter) is the only thing I need to keep an eye on and ensure it has time to regenerate (only a 10-15 minute drive).  I perform most of the servicing myself meticulously without specialised tools and overall I feel I got what I paid for.I find most of the critical parts in Captiva's are very good to excellent brands including: Bosch (electrics/sensors), Aisin (gearbox), VM Motori (diesel engine), Chevrolet (V6 Engine).The interior is cheap, paint and panels are thin, unpainted plastics fade quickly if a restorer is not used frequently etc etc but all of this is reflected in the purchase price.
My Captiva is just 5years old but cost too much for service aircon does't work paid $1,500 the engine sign keeps blinking now after  I paid more than 1k of it  to fix  no results like to cry for this car. Cant say good about my car. Hate it .
We bought our captiva brand new and have regretted it ever since. The car compared to others is very dated and within a year the gearbox went and the electric window in the front died. The car engine computer has also had lots of issues that we have had to take back to holden and we have found them quite unhelpful and dismissive. Very disappointing.
My wife & I purchased the latest Captiva LTZ in April 2017. After reading reviews I wondered if I had made the right choice. My wife & I haven’t had any mechanical or electrical problems thus far with the car. The vehicle drives well and is enjoyable with good acceleration. The comfort of the interior is good. I have appreciated the safety factor of AWD vehicles. I give the car a four star rating. For a modern 3 litre petrol engine, the fuel consumption is high. The Holden Dealer and manufacturer stated, the car does 10 litres per 100 kilometres, in reality, the car does 13lts per 100ks (21 miles per gallon) My previous car was a Toyota Kluger, AWD, 3.3 litre engine. Fuel consumption was 10 litres per 100 ks regardless. (28 miles per gallon) The other dislike with the Captiva is, the car honks the horn if the driver hops out the car before the passenger, it honks the horn 3 times. This a nuisance late at night when my neighbours are asleep. The car will honk the horn when there’s no passenger and the driver alights from the car and shuts the door. ( Not always, but why sometimes, who knows?) The side step is a nuisance for short people. Holden need to get rid of this useless feature.
Hi my 2007 Holden captiva petrol has no power won't unlock and nothing on dash is working it started but konked out please can someone help me and the airbag light and car door light keeps coming on and off and Speedo is stuck on any help be appreciated thnx
Love our car only problem no CD player but live everything else about it very cheap to run very comfortable for long distance  driving .having no CD player is a nuisance because I don't have music on phone ok for younger people but there is a lot of people out there who would like the option of a CD player
The design and of the car and it’s room and 7 seats were great. Engine, turbo, electrical issues were endless. It was always going back with faults and in the end we sold it back to golden just to get rid of it as in the last 6 months of owning it it spent more time being repaired than us driving it. We originally were sold it based on features and fuel economy but it chewed through diesel and never came close to promised fuel economy. It’s name craptiva is well earned.
Bought it for our growing family fits everyone in nicely Lots of extras in the cx model was really suprisezed with the standard features the vehicle comes withOnly down side no child restraints in the third rowGreat car on road easy to handleComfort is greatAir con is amazingVery responsive Cheap to run Haven't been able to fault it
My Holden Captiva LX 2010 is the best car I've ever had, the diesel car is fantastic and very fuel efficient. The handling of the car, for such a large car is quite impressive. The interior design is everything I've ever wanted, leather seats, automatic rear view mirrors, sunroof and a navigation system sums up how good a car this is. It is very roomy for a big family, however the only negative thing that I have to say about the car is the navigation system not being able to update.  Other wise the car is very cheap to run for such a large car, I was contemplating the diesel or petrol and I'm certainly glad I decided on diesel, while you get the vibrations of the diesel car, you certainly save money per tank.
Bought brand new Captiva Active, the car has amazing value, 7 seater under 30k with leather seat and even sunroof. The driving experience is expected from a 2.4L engine which is a little sluggish yet thirsty, especially when trying to overtake. The ride is rough, even on the sealed road, once my friend told me it drives like a truck.
I have brought eh holden captiva 7 seater in 2009  and has not face any major issues with the condition of the car , the handling is smooth and the engine is silent , however in term of fuel consumption is not as economic it is a good family car with spacious rooms and cargo space when backseats are pull down
Will this car gets me from a to b it does have a lot of problems. The engine light and air bag light are nearly always on even after services and repairs. It absolutely eats fuel which I could deal with if it wasn't such a slug. On a plus side it is very comfortable, lots of space and hidden compartments. It is easy to drive but I wouldn't ever purchase another captiva
Bought a 2nd 2013 turbo diesel 8 months ago and now it has a cracked head gasket. I'm so disappointed and out $4000. Shattered was hoping to pull our little caravan around Aus with this. Sensors also got dirty quickly. Has always had its service when due. :( :( :(
It is such a good car. Turbo engin with 2.0T is powerful enough for me drive around the city. It's good for a family also for individual. It is also a good choice for camping and long trips. The colour I bought is black which could be a bit hot indoor in the summer time.
Great too drive but doesn't like unsealed roads had a fuel line t section break 4days too find parts great legroom good on fuel when running no roadside assistance (towing)Very good storage  quite running  good lights great mirrors drink holders too small and too close together great to ceal
the car is great fro families, the sun roof, and media player are great features. but the problem is the SUv has low milage. I find that i have to fill up at times, twice a week. definitely not a budget car but its okay for those who dont drive a lot
My Captiva is a 2013 SX with the 2.4L Petrol Engine. The car had been used in the City and had 35k on the clock. ECO button made no difference and it appeared to be struggling. Took it in for its final 36 month service and asked for it to be hooked up to the diagnostics. It returned a different car, engine much quieter, and gearbox was a dream with changes exactly when you wanted them up and down. The car ride was harsh, down to city driving, took it over a few speed ramps at speed, and the suspension freed up, and is now a much nicer and quieter ride. I have been told by the Holden guys that if you by a secondhand Captiva, Disconnect the battery overnight, which will reset the computer and the car will adapt to your driving style. For me, the ECO button now works wonderfully and make a huge difference, whereas before the tweak, it did nothing at all. If you want a lot of bang for your buck, the Captiva is the car to chose, and the petrol 2.4 option is I am told the most reliable engine as its built in the US. I have always had a VW, so a Holden was a bit of dissapointment in terms of luxuries, such as outside temperature, climate control, and fuel computer, but I can live with that given the huge price differential. A bargain is what I wanted, and for the money a bargain is what I got.
It's a great family car it can fit the biggest child restraints on the market in the rear facing position without comprising front seat leg space. I have not once had any unusual issues have kept regular with servicing and honestly it's a nice looking car inside and out. Has a lot of power and can easily over take large road trains on the highways out west.
There are much better SUVs out there than this one.Oh, where to start?The heavy SUV uses a 4-cylinder ~120kw petrol engine. This is not good for hauling trailers or even hauling its own weight with full passenger and luggage capacity. Tends to make excessive engine noise.The engine should've been a diesel, not petrol. Not a very smart move by GM.The black plastic accents are not quality material as the colour fades from sun exposure.Colour needs to be maintained by applying silicone spray to it. Otherwise it looks trashy.For the Australian market, it's also bad that there's no a/c vents for the rear passengers (except for foot vents underneath the front seats). As we know, days tend to get pretty hot around here, so it's not good that only the front seats have a/c vents.Anyone sitting in the rear seats don't receive much of the cool air. What's worse is that the seats are small, which means it's only suitable for small adults or children under the age of 15.Which leads to another negative. The two rear seats are tiny with such minimal leg room that it's not really possible to move your legs at all. And when these seats are in use, the boot space is also tiny.You can't fit a full schoolbag in the back with those seats up.The air conditioning system is weak. The air conditioner's max speed is equivalent to a gentle breeze. It's a joke.Doesn't do much on a searing hot day.The GPS that came as an extra is a complete waste of $3000.It's junk. It's ridiculously slow and inaccurate. You have to take it to the dealer to get it updated and they CHARGE you for it.You can get a much better multimedia system+GPS for $2000 and update the GPS yourself.The turning circle on this SUV is dreadful, too.Very wide. Need lots of room to do a U-turn. Compared to other SUVs, this is just...bad.Onto the positives now...It has decent suspension and power windows and cup holders.Also has cruise control and airbags.Wowww!!!1!Don't buy this car.
Bought a very cheap 220,000 km 2006 Captiva but luckily had a decent scan tool to track faults (first of many) down. The first codes identified the throttle system (throttle position) but didn't identify which part (throttle body or throttle peddle assembly so I replaced body first ($180 aftermarket & easy to fit. Unfortunately the problem reoccurred so I replaced the peddle assem and that fixed that. However, in the 4 years since I've changed regulator in the alternator (much cheaper than replacing whole unit); 2 wheel speed sensors (after dash lit up like a Christmas tree disabling traction control system). Buy good ones $149 each as the Chinese ones don't work; oil pressure switch at $80 after light came on (engine sounded the same so kept driving for 2mths before replacing and the big one was timing chain (easy the diagnose with scan tool) was $1500 in parts. Note that despite all the hysteria you'll see in this being an issue with all allotechs it only affected 2006-2007 models & once done will not repeat as replacement chains pockets are bigger. I also have a 2008 WM statesman with 210,000 since new with normal servicing and it runs like new. Anyway back to the craptiva which now has 330,000ks on it (could this be a record!) and I'll keep putting bandaids on it until it just stops & I told my wife to then park it, call a taxi and meet me at the Toyota dealer. Oh just forgot, check engine light permanently on as catalytic convertor stuffed (easy fix is to buy spark plug antifoulers as o2 sensor spacers from the states - fixed one side but now the other bank code has come up but I just can't be bothered as it doesn't seem to affect performance (no rocketship when working right anyway); electronics generally are hit & miss with cruise control, indicators, wipers having a mind of their own. Bad sludge came out at last service at only 7,500 k's from last oil change (a good mineral oil) so I think the end is nigh! Really practical design car but pity about the quality.  Don't buy unless it's really really cheap, you have time to tinker and are handy with the tools...
I purchased this car new in 2012 mainly because of the size (7 seats) and price. It drives well on the open road and around town. Can be a bit sluggish initially as the engine is only small for a large vehicle, but I chose the smaller engine as it was all I needed. Plenty of space for the kids and it is really easy to keep clean. I love the seating position. Holden service was fantastic and they have fixed a couple of small issues with the alternator (replaced once), but is the only issue with this car in over 5 years. Service costs are low. I have had no problems with this car and take care of it to ensure it serves me and my family well. Running costs are very low.
I have a 2012 Hold Captiva which I bought second hand and since found that it had been in a smash and was not happy as a result the holden dealer offered to upgrade the sat nav and also install new passenger door handle that broke. Door handle repaired but have been informed that they cannot update the sat nav as there is none. is this correct
Everything works well, and the car was fantastic value for a new 7 seater SUV 4WD with towing ability.This replaced a 10 year old Mazda Tribute V6 and we tow a 15ft caravan. The Captiva does it with ease, with better fuel consumption, and has a higher tow rating.The vehicle is not as big as some other beasts and parks easily. Bluetooth etc works well.Holden service has been good.The dislike: summer air conditioning performance - the sunroof transmits heat and should be insulated - I have not found a way to do this myself. Also, the engine coolant reservoir sits next to the air inlet plenum which preheats the air and makes very hot day air conditioning difficult. I placed some insulation in between, as Holden would not admit to this problem. Fuel consumption was excellent initially, but does vary.
Brought out brand new diesel Captiva in February 2013. We had our car serviced by an independent mechanic, first service after the new car warrently expired. All prior services done through Holden. The mechanic noticed an engine oil leak! Only 10Weeks outside of the warrently expiring. The mechanic said there was no way this was a new oil leak! It would have been leaking for many months. I contacted Holden customer care, who have been great! The car went back to Holden in June 2016. I was told the leak was coming from the timing case seal. Holden under good will covered all expenses. 6 mths after the engine repair our car was serviced again by our mechanic! December 2016. Again he found oil leaking from the engine. The car was retured to Holden for the second major engine repair. This time being told it was the lower sump causing the oil leak. June 2017 our car had it scheduled service. To my disbelief the mechanic found oil still leaking from the engine! I again phoned customer care! Car dropped off to Holden AGAIN! This time Holden saying they don't believe the engine to be leaking oil! Come back in 1-2 thousand Kilometers for them to assess. I've just taken the car back to my mechanic for him to assess. The engine is leaking oil.. I saw the oil leaks with my own eyes! The car is now booked in for the fourth time. Can the leak be fixed??? This is my experience with buying a Holden Captiva! The worst car I've ever brought!
Bought my Captiva in 2013.Researched around for a while till i found one i was happy with for the right price. I have heard of a few lemons so really picky. Bought 2nd hand with 60,000 km on it. Diesel engine seems to be good so far. (i have put 30,000 km on it. No issues but thought the fuel economy would of been better, even after considering the weight and distances traveled. For a smaller SUV 7 seater, i am happy with the purchase 2 years later.
Still early days but the car is going well. Plenty of power with the V6. Great value for money compared to other top of the range 7 seater SUVs. CarPlay was a bit buggy but nothing too major. Seemed to work again after turning ignition on and off again. Pretty happy.
I required a SUV vehicle to get me around due to being disabled after looking at fords,hondas,hyandi and other so liked cars I found that the Captiva was easier to get in and out off. Petrol and economy of the car is really good at the moment I am getting around 650kilometers in city traffic and around 845 in highway traffic
normal performance, lower pricelack of technology, lower pricenormal service, lower pricegood room sizespeed up very slow, not sure 0~100 take how long, maybe 10s+not sure about the transmission, but driving experience not good as Japanese carsdealer service not good, normal level, will not back to this again
Great Car, SuitableFor family. Affordable. Very pleased with price, capacity, Fuctionality. Not quiet fuel efficient though. However it is great on the long distance driving. Customer service staffs at Phoenix holder were very good. Explained every possible feature and also assisted to fit the car into the budget as well.
Poor turning circle,engine issues lights comming on.It lost power on the freeway and had to be towed away.Scary for mum and daughter the engine was grinding loudly. Sunroof leaking down the seatbelt strap..Air con vents poor, out put drivers side minimal.Have spent a fortune with repairs.Fuel consumption poor.Positive note it's a good size but that's it.
Previous two Captiva's I bought we 2nd hand , this one I purchased new, a petrol LTZ. I Have not had a fault with any. My new one rides even better than previous models. I tow a caravan with it (1.6 ton) and handles it very well. I love the shape. I do not like the shape of the Equip which is the upcoming  replacement for Captiva. Excellent sales and service.
The car was listed as at promotional pricing so we decided to go new rather than buy used.Very pleased with the purchase. We have had the car for 6 months and are very pleased with the performance and comfort. Only minor repair made during 1000 km check up.Good economy.Have owned Holdens in the past and am as pleased with this as with previous cars.Dealer very helpful - whole transaction through the web
Hi, Buyer Beware and also let's see if there is a Major Issue with Captivas Electronics systems and Door Actuators. My car is 5 years old and now giving me a lot of issues and costing over $4000 now in six months. Not happy at all. Never again.   Actuator and Radio replacement over $1800. Why is this happening while my car has been services on time and always looked after.Never buy a Captiva. I bought this from Ferntree Gully.
We have a 5 seater, manual Holden Captiva that we bought second hand and absolutely love it. Heaps of room for our kids, and easy to drive. We find it fine for fuel economy (although is more expensive from the old Mazda 121 we used to have) and just a really reliable car. We love the parking sensors, and built in sat nav too!
I am very happy with my Captiva. It handles well and I have had no problems with it at all. It is very quiet and my son is now learning how to drive in it. There is plenty of room for three teenage boys and a large dog. Average running costs. I can only fault the material seats stain easy even though they are black.
Where to start with the  crappy car or the poor service at Cheltenham 3192 .One thing they will not tell you is that  on the diesel model when a light comes on it's time to clean the diesel fuel filter you will have to drive your car for approximately 20km or 20 mins  or your  filter will not clean properly and your fuel economy will suffer, this is the biggest pain in the butt.For that and that alone I wouldn't  purchase a Captiva. I also ran out of diesel once and some part melted away and the new part alone costs $2500, so my mechanic found me a second hand part for $1100 so all up running out of fuel cost me $3000 yes that’s right a second hand part and all $3000.I get about 500 km a tank around town and freeway driving it's a 60lt tank. There is a flat spot sometimes when I take off and it has nearly got me in trouble so I have now changed my driving  habits.When you get free servicing they will not change things that need changing like filters they will do the minimum required even if it states in your book something should have been changed, I only realised that when I got my car serviced by my usual mechanic,  he was horrified with my air  filter condition.  In three years they never rotated my tyres. I had countless things wrong with my car, CD player not working,wipers not working, seatbelt fraying,leather  seats with soft leather in some areas that started to crack , leaking back window, GPS navigation maps are out of date even if you buy a brand-new car,  there is a lag in the satellite navigation, you can have passed the street and it still thinks you are  approaching the street,  Bluetooth works intermittently, black trims fade. In terms of customer service, as soon as they don't know how to fix your car they will start lying to you.This was the first time  we purchased a brand-new car and I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Holden Australia and there crappy car. I was going to sell it and buy a Toyota but realised it has a very poor resale  value so I'm stuck with it.
Holden Captiva 4cyl Turbo Diesel , 7 seater, Semi Automatic I can't fault this car call me lucky call me what you want , My husband and I had everyone try and steer us away from buying a so called Craptiva, I can honestly say i have had no drama's with mine i bought it 2nd hand have owned it for nearly 2yrs and it's been a dream only thing i have had to buy for it is a new Battery , other than that my model has Leather seater, climate control, 6 stack cd player usb capability built in Navigation system, is very spacious and such a pleasure to drive.... I have never been so in love with a car and this is coming from someone that has always owned 4x4.... i also find mine fantastic on fuel quiet and reliable..... Wouldn't think twice about buying another one :)
this car has no fun to drive, to big for parking and fuel consumption is even worset , i drove 23 L per km which makes me crazy. the resume value is very low, i have seen 8000 car on car sales for 2009 model. not a big fan for holden and this car is organally from korea
i bought this car from castle hill showroom in 2013 January and since then this car is giving me trouble every now and then.In its  2nd year it has major transmission problem and it got replaced due to it was in warranty and again few months ago i had engine problem which is not covered and ended up spending 2K.most of the NRMA told me that they always get call for this car due to their transmission issue.
Hello... I have a Holden Captiva serious 2 deisel2011 model... Tried jump starting due to it not starting... revs n dash lights still bright and car lights working and still  car won't start, turn the key can't really hear anything only a click sound and car won't start had road assistant come out and he sis t even know what it could be so I'm hoping to fi d out what it could be.. could it. E the starter motor or something else a fuse or so help needed please and thank you
I am not a big Fan of Holden. But, one thing attracted me to this car was its look. I bought it with great expectations and I don't regret my decision at all. This is wonderful Diesel car with a lot of room in it. Simply this car has value for money.
Bought my Captiva 7 2012 brand new 4 years ago. After reading mixed reviews (Craptiva) went ahead anyway and made the purchase. To date have not had one single problem with the car. It is very slow to take off and is in no way a fast car. This doesn't bother me but may bother others. It Is cheap to run on fuel and 7 seats when needed makes it a bonus.
Before I test drove my 2016 Holden captiva LTZ I thought about a Nissan xtrail, well....I soon changed my mind quick, the performance is overall good, comfortability is excellent, heaps of space and leg room, the fuel ratio is very reasonable, now the "features" Bluetooth, GPS, dual air-con, an the sound system is not the best but still doesn't distort when cruising with the tunes. Great reverse camera, Overall very happy with Holden.
Second hand 2014 7 LS purchased with 45000 on the clock is ex lease.  Very nice to drive, love keyless entry and ignition.  Love reversing camera and sensors.  Lots of mixed reviews made the decision to proceed nerve wracking. But so far very happy. Will be sure to report back in coming years on our experiences.Averaging about 500km of city driving per tank which is not great but I knew that was possibility. So many air bags!
We bought our 2009 Captiva second hand with 50000kms on it, now 6 years later it has 93000kms and it hasn't missed a beat. Very reliable comfortable car. Every car on the market will get bad reviews, but I believe a car is as good as you treat it.I have owned 4 Holdens,  2 Fords,  1 Hyundai, 1 Toyota and never had any troubles with any cars.
5 years 18 warranty/service faults some major like transmission .... engine out 2 times , bad customer service from 2 local dealers ..... mixed with done good , but overall a car should perform way better than that from new .... Holden has lost the Captiva battle - it's Craptiva
Bought it for my wife Nov  last year ( 7 months now) when it was less than 2 years old and with 33k on odometer. Was hesitant buying a Captiva as some of the online reviews  were negative.   So far so good. No issues. Just booked it in with Holden for next service and was told the service is free!  Was expecting to pay a few hundred.   It is driven mostly locally. But been to Blue Mountains once and soon will be going to Snowy Mountains. Main reason we picked it was because of  price and having 7 seats.  The performance is better than I expected, but with 1.8 tonnes and large/tall  SUV  frontal area and 2.4 L engine, don't expect fireworks. The wife is happy as it has good fuel economy, given the size,  and lots of bells and whistles.
The car itself is not the fanciest, the interior is a little dated. and the design has been pretty much standard for 12 years. however, for under $30k you get a very comfortable 7 seater vehicle, happy for the kids to fit in the proper back row seating. huge boot for carrying a load and all the bells and whistles like apple car play and reversing camera built in. it leaves very little to be desired.
My air conditioner stopped working. Called in at Robina Holden where I purchased the Captiva in 2007. They quoted $2655.15 to replace compressor and receiver dryer. I nearly fainted at the price. The quote cost $220.75. Contacted Brendan at "ICY COOL" who called at my home and fitted New compressor, filter, new seals, O rings and flush. All Genuine parts. TOTAL COST $1100-00 including labour. Over a period of 25 years I have had numerous new model Holden cars but never again from Robina Holden.
I love this car it has everything I was looking for without the expensive price tag . Leather seats . 7 seater . Reverse camera . Sun roof and much more. It drives well I always have the eco button on. It's just the right size for my family. I can't fault this car
I have always had manual cars and trucks, so was hesitant about buying an auto, but during a test drive was very surprised how smooth the gear changes were, it has plenty of power for overtaking even on ECO setting​.Comfortable seats, no sore back even on long trips,Rides very smoothExcellent brakesLooks stylish, great paint finish, beautiful 19" unmarked wheels, Excellent Value for MoneyWas still under warranty when purchased at 40k Only negative comments from me areNo engine temperature gauge.Interior fit and finish could be improved ( some squeeks from dash over rough roadsPoor visibility through rear windscreenEven though it is LTZ model did not have reversing camera fitted.All in All I give it 8/10
We bought a Captiva, cautiously after reading many reviews, but we found this vehicle - 7 seater to be very reliable, comfortable and maybe one of the best vehicles we have bought. We traveled from Cains to Tasmania and found it incredibly comfortable, even slept in it one night. I couldn't be happier with it, even for a biggish car my wife loves driving it. She finds it easy to park. having revers cambers also helps :)
Little bit noisy, during second service dealership noticed that there was a engine oil leak, which got fixed under warranty. While fixing the leak they did noticed that there was another oil leak but they didn't fix at that time. After 8 I noticed the leak as the leak was getting bigger and leaving oil puddles in my drive way so I took it to the nearest dealership as they told me I have to keep my car there for a week so they can fix it.After week I picked up my car from the dealership, next day when I went to work was making loud noise so I called dealership they told me to bring it in When I got there they told me that they have to keep it for few more days.After couple of days they called me and told me that they have to keep car for longer period of time so they can order new transmission and seal kit.  I got my car back after 21 days with new transmission. I asked them to give me report of what they have done to my car then dealership told me to call holden as they have paid for the job and they will give you the report. I called holden customer service but they told me that I have to get this report from local dealer, I have been keep contacting the dealership and holden but no one is giving me report.After year later engine oil started leaking again and got fixed under warranty.No the touch screen is not working, contacted Holden customer service. they replied me saying that they will book in with local dealership to check the car and asked me to provide VIN. I gave them VIN and my details but no one have contacted me since then.
Traded my Cruze for a used Captiva as a baby was on the way. Was looking for a cheap 7 sitter and considered the fiat Fremont and the Captiva, however atrocious depreciation on both models meant I selected a used Captiva.Nothing exceptional about the car, gets the job done. Comfort levels in the cabin just about below average with the cabin style and layout at least an generation behind the Cruze.Given the notorious reputation of the model, I went in for a 3 year Holden factory warranty extension and religiously look after the motor.No mechanical problems so far with 65k kms on the clock. 2.4 is a noisy rough running unit, that revs hard to push the 1.8 tonne bulk of the car.There is significant engine and tyre noise reaching the cabin at freeway speeds making the ride unpleasant.Had minor issues with plastic bits on door trims and dash breaking off, but replaced under warranty.As far as fuel consumption goes the best I have achieved is as under- freeway 9.5/100km- pure hilly suburban 14-15l/100kmI typically get 450-500 km per tank on an average I.e. 13-14l/100 km.It's decent value for the price and I would recommend it if you wanted something no frills with 7 seats.If you want real driving pleasure look elsewhere.If you are going to use the 3rd row seats all the time, please note there are no rear AC vents and the cooling is not effective beyond the front rows on the really hot days, specially if the car has been parked in the sun for a while.Overall value for money, but would get something else if I had extra 7-10 grand to spend.———————————-Update: the motor made a tapping noise at around 66,000 kms; service centre diagnosed as vibrating cam phasers, replaced under extended warranty.Further the problem reoccurred with a loss of power at 70,000 kms. diagnosed as timing chain problems. Got a new timing chain kit installed unde extended warranty.——————————-Update 75,000kmReplaced OEM Kumho 798 plus radials with Falken Ziex 914, the car is a different animal now, quieter and better handling.Have had noisy cold starts all winter so keeping an eye on the timing gear.
The Captiva, although a little thirsty, has made my life enjoyable again. It has a large boot space that easily accomodates a static mobility scooter lifter, my mobility scooter, and a load from IKEA. The interior, passenger and rear seats were a major consideration of purchase for a 6' 4" son & son in law.It drives beautifully & handles well with a user friendly dash. One of the best vehicles I have owned.
Driving good but light on dash very expensive to repair poor performance due to timing belt delays and engine light on dash good shape and room for family but very unreliable due to delays on timing belt function and engine controls all functions delays and starting delays when turn on with key. Interior nice and running cost is poor due to engine failure and fuel function.
The 2011 holden Captiva LX diesel turbo looks great and feels nice to drive. It was top of that range so it had all the creature comforts we wanted and enough space with the seven seats. This is all useless if the car keeps breaking down and costs a fortune to repair anything!!After all log book services done the engine decides to finally fail. It sounded like a piston was going to shoot out of the bonnet.We only had 139k on the odometer and we were told by holden that they would have to strip the engine to find the problem, only 13hrs @ $150.00 an hour! Then who knows what they might find and what we might have to spend. After arguing with the service manager who wanted to drain my bank account  we finally took the car back. The Captiva was worth around 40k new, I was lucky to get 2k for a trade in.DONT BUY A HOLDEN.I will never buy a holden again in my lifetime.
Running costs are high should have got diesel, driving is good but you feel all the bumps on the road, car is new and just had to have both keys re set as one had stopped working. Otherwise happy with the car great family car and rear vision is good
Good zippy little SUV. Fairly basic interior. It has performed quite well for the past 6 years that I've owned the car, but the fuel economy isn't great and the turning circle is terrible. My husbands very large 4WD has a better turning circle!!I can fit three car seats across the back which is great! The boot is spacious as is the front passenger seat with regards to leg room.It has been a good family car and has come down a lot in price since I bought mine in 2011, which makes it better value.
Just don't like the turning circle at all.Seats are a little dodgy too putting them up and down.Nice looking car and comfy but think I should have bought a Mitsubishi Outlander.Oh well overall it's not a terrible cost for a car but certainly not the best choice that's for sure
I currently get 10.3km per 100. This is suburban driving and looking forward to seeing what I can get with freeway driving. Very reliable with plenty of lights to indicate if something is wrong. Smooth handling with 18 inch tyres that give a quite safe drive in the wet and dry.
Such a reliable family car. Parts are cheap to find. Very good, tyres last. Drove to Sydney and back several times. I would love to upgrade my car same model different year because it's getting a bit old now. But overall performance is 10/10 smooth drive and diesel is a plus great on petrol
Advertised consumption is 10 L but reality is no where near it.It looks like it's a big car but the centre rear seat can only accommodate a child up 12 year old.No Bluetooth, no auxiliary.I mean are you serious?Good things are;Lot of air bags.Outside looks are great.
2011 CG 5 AWD Series IIPurchased this car at the end of 2013, it had just over 12K on the clock. It handles great and has a excellent fuel consumption. The interior is basic (how I like it, so there not too many issues!) but roomier than I thought the Captivas were. I dislike that they have removed the temp gauge off the dashboard and it also has an electric handbrake, which I also dont like. The rear boot is quite noisy when it shuts, its sounds like a really cheap plastic door that is coming loose. It isnt greatly comfy to sit in over long distances either.We started having starting issues with it after a couple of months. It was still under New Car Warranty but they couldnt find the problem. The car would try to start but would turn over around 4 times, which sounded horrible, and then would switch off. This could last for upto 10 minutes and then would start fine. This would happen in any sort of weather, so it wasnt that the car was cold, it was just crap. I brought it up with Holden everytime it went in for a service, they would tell me they 'tested' all the things that were needed and couldnt find a problem. At one point they said it was an issue with the battery leads, so they changed them. It wasnt, it kept doing it. Still an issue to date.We noticed soot under the bonnet (Sept 2016) near where the turbo is. Got Holden to check when it was getting serviced and they told me the turbo would need to be replaced as it had an internal crack but wasnt urgent etc etc. This car, at that point, was only 5 years old. It is ridiuclous that a car, after 60000 Km and only 5 years old, needs a new turbo.
Despite the lack is mod cons that the newer car brands have. The golden captivia 2013 7 seater has all the necessary features of a family suv.  Blue tooth, 7 seats or 5 seats and big boot for going away. Seats fold down to convert to a station wagon to pick up those bulky items.  Cruise control, sun roof and rear parking sensors make a slightly bigger suv confortable to drive and park.  The side step makes it easier for smaller children to get in and out and USB port plus CD player gives you the versatility that newer models lack. The auto headlights come on when the wipers are on, which is great, however this does affect the lighting of the speedo and other dashboard displays . This makes the speedo difficult to see, which is manageable, but not preferable.
Great car to drive, very economical to run, plenty of power, all the up to date modern features and accessories. Plenty of room for a family of 5 with the added space/seats for extra people or luggage. The only negatives it appears that parts are expensive to replace, the seat heater switch around $450.00, which of course not covered under the warranty.
We purchased Feb 2016. Can't wait to sell! The advertised fuel consumption was 10.1/100 (petrol) after 12 months and 30000kms still haven't got under 12.9/100km on cruise control freeway driving. 65 litre tank and we can't even travel 500km. Naturally Holden checked and everything is perfect - of course it is they are not paying the fuel bill! Love everything else!
I have to say I was a bit unsure, as the reviews are pretty bad. My experience is the captive was nice to drive Handles great little heavy on fuel. Plenty of head home as well. My main beef was with the sunroof not being a factor fitted product. Replacement costs were a bit step
Where are the parking sensors on a Holden Captiva? I must have turned it off and now I have no lights on the screen or no beeping when I get to close to something.. Please help as I use need it on being short I can't see much up close
I have a 2012 model and it drives beautifully. I have had no issues and it's very cheap to serviceThere is plenty of room in the back for my kids and plenty of boot space too. Great on petrol and very comfortable and easy to drive. I love sitting up that little bit higher without the feeling of being in a huge 4WD
70,000 km in 6 years, regular service by not a holden dealer. Engine light comes on, gonna cost $8000 to fix!. Apparently timming chains stretched and motor is stuffed.. 10 year / 250,000 warranty.. but not covered as we went sum one else to do service....oh and we brought a HSV v8 just recently .. gonna wait for that to stop working.. what happens to loyalty?? am waiting to hear back from holden to see if they will help..not holding breath. So i have a big paper weight .. #leavebadtasteinmouth   ..#NOTBUYINGHOLDENAGAIN
There were & still are numerous problems with my car & this tends to sour the driving experience badly. And there have been no major problems yet. I'm positive there is no quality control in Korea. Outside panel fit on the car is not good (alignment,etc). The diesel motor is noisy at low speeds & somehow the fuel economy is getting worse as the car is getting older. Gear changes are smooth in the automatic. The suspension can be rough sometimes. Inside it is comfortable & the 7 seats are handy. With the repairs I've had done to date, I find that even the Holden dealers leave a lot to be desired. In my experience they tend to lie & do dodgy repairs. Save yourself the frustration, take note of the bad reviews & look for something else. Wish I had, many, many times. With a Captiva it's a 50/50 chance to get a good or bad one. Lot of money to spend for a game of chance.
Have the latest Captiva LTZ Diesel Turbo and we enjoy driving it. Our last Captiva was a v6 and although we enjoyed that one, this one is more powerful and has a handful of more gadgets that help out. I would highly recommend for a Family, as the room inside is spacious and the seven seats a godsend.
This car represents great value for money, we have come from a Toyota RAV 4 and found that this car has all the same feature but at a significantly cheaper price.  It is heavy on fuel use averaging 10.1lt per 100km (we live in the country so its mostly long distance 100km/h ... expected better fuel economy than this).Plenty of space for a tall driver and still some leg room in the back.The android auto integration is slow to respond and often drops back to the main screen (better to just use google maps on the phone).
The Captiva has proven to be a wonderfully reliable vehicle that has all the features expected.It is powered by a 3 litre petrol engine (e10 compatible), 6 speed automatic transmission with all wheel drive.The 3 litre V6 engine combined with the 5 forward speeds delivers sufficient power and control for normal road travel. Our everyday trip requires climbing the Bells Line of Road over the Blue Mountains which it handles with ease. The transition between gears is smooth, although immediate response for fast acceleration is slightly lagging.Our unit is fitted with a heavy duty tow pack and again the drive is smooth and easy.Current fuel consumption is 10-11 litres per 100km using e10.The interior is spacious with a large luggage area with the rear seats down, plenty of leg room and comfortable seating.Drivers compartment is roomy with electric adjustable seat control, great when changing drivers.Instrument panel is well laid out and easily accessible. Controls are configured well with the exception to the audio system which can be confusing at first.The added features of phone connectivity, navigation sun roof, electric mirrors, climate control air conditioning etc make for a great driving experience.Although the navigation system is out of date it is reliable, an update is available through Holden at a cost.There is plenty of storage for drink and cups whilst traveling.The interior finishes includes leather that does require a little more attention compared to fabric and other styles of trim but is very comfortable.Exterior paint and finishes are quality and with the included 19" alloy wheels, roof racks, side steps and tinted windows make for a smart looking SUV.Overall the Captiva LX  makes great family car, well appointed with many added luxuries that is easy to handle and drive. Fuel economy is the only slight drawback we have encountered.I would reco
The Holden Captiva is packed with great features. One of the most useful is the floor of the rear space being level with the bottom of the rear door. This is particularly useful if you need to transport anyone with a mobility aid. Wheelchairs and walkers are easy to transport.  It is great for children with electronic devices as there are rear car plug sockets for recharging. While the driver is sitting higher than a standard car and can adapt to any road issues ahead, it does come at a rather high petrol consumption. However, you can't have all that power without  using the fuel. It has a very up-to-date sound system, with rear speakers, USB socket, external earphone Socket and many hidden storage spaces. It is a vehicle that is highly recommended and st an on road cost that is truly competitive, you are onto a winner with this Holden.
We recently purchased a 2017 2.4L 2wd. It runs smoothly with minimal to normal road sounds. As a 4wd style vehicle it is more bumpy then a sedan as the suspension is different being higher off the ground.As it is set usually in Eco mode it is slightly slow for take off but still in traffic it is not slow and is responsive. It easily reaches the normal speed limits without any struggle.It has a very reasonable turning circle for a suv and if base model comes with reversing camera with is very convenient.The doors a quite light and easily opened by children so though a normal parenting duty make sure the child safety is on.The car comes with halogen run lights for all time lights and when in auto shows you when it has imitated full lights.Interior is solid with some cheapness for instance the locks have cheap red stickers on them. The material is nice and seats are easily adjusted for comfort.Whilst no vents are found in the rear of the car they have ducts under the front seats providing air conditioning to the back.The boot is spacious and beneath the boards is three different sized compartments for storage and a 12volt plug in. Though the boot doesn't have handless closing I am short and have no issues closing the boot with the interns handle.A great feature is the CarPlay that syncs with your phone and charges it. This allows message read out map, music, phone calls and podcast play. It is great since the laws require hands off phones.The fuel consumption is a slight bit higher then the minimum achieveable we average 10.9L instead of 9.9L. But since Holden states between about 9-13 it is reasonable.For the price of the car it is great and perfect for families since it has the new isofix points for new car seats making install super easy.I am short my partner tall we both fit comfortably in either side even with a child in a car seat in the back.I completely recommend this car for young families.
Purchased a 2013 Captiva7 and was told the GPS would be updated regularly. Many complaints to Holden and the GPS has never been updated. It is the worst GPS unit I have ever come across. Holden pass the blame to the GPS manufacturer stating there is nothing which can be done. I do not recommend this car due to GPS. If this was fixed, the review on this car would be great. Unfortunately, the GPS unit lets it down as it is unusable.
this is  the  third one i have had  and  for  a family it ticks  all the boxes that suits my needs some faults  driving  vision is not good  when approaching intersection the  way the front pillars are placed  its  turning  circle could be better because of this  parking in narrow  streets can prove difficult
The car drives well but lack of power when you need it. The aircon system is really bad only useful for the 2 front seats the back seats never get cold air!With the time (3yrs+) there are so many lights in the dashboard with issues that holden "cannot fix PROPERLY" that it's unreliable to drive long distances.the design and the looks are beautiful.
Very reliable car for short distances. Anything over 100 Ks forget it, very noisey on highway. Creaks rattles clunks hisses and it's turning circle is embarrassing especially at Permitted U turns places. I thought I had talked myself into the good aspects of series 2, I was warned by others not to do it under any circumstance I didn't listen and was branded with a lemon.
A couple of design faults from my point of view, the rear door does not give enough clearance when opened have whacked my head a couple of times especially when not on level surface. Navigation system useless , screen needs to be set back to ovoid glare and be able to be adjusted at an angle . Shiney surfaces reflect glare making it I possible to see the screen even with sun glasses on. Other than the high fuel usage so far I have had a good run.
easy to drive some cheap plastic interior cap service and economical fuel consumption so many futures and enough leg room for passengers  missing folding mirror and rainsensors vipers not easy access to third row seats and not big boot after third row seats up after all captiva is very good car
Speak to anyone in the car industry (except holden) and they will tell you what the nick name is for theseCRAPTIVAHorribly underpowered and so riddled with faults i cant even begin to name them allI worked at a panel shop for a year and the panel beaters were quick to show me the cheap nasty design faults that each and every model has.Add to that holdens horrible back up service with warranties and your just begging for it..
Bought our brand new captiva LTZ 7 seater 2.2 diesel 03/2014, to be our family car for the years to come. I am now trying to get rid of it. after 9000 Km the engine leaked oil, after three days at work shop and few months later the car is going in again another three days to have the engine removed to have another go at fixing the problem. The dealers would not let you in on these problem, they will happily take your money. I say DONT BUY the CAPTIVA leave it in their yard
Excellent SUV. .I have a 2.2 diesel and done 70,000 kms.No issues at all.Good 4 WD performance. I own another costly SUV but the value of Captiva is amazing.Excellent family car.very spacious. Engine bit noisy at low revs and on sudden acceleration but can't fault the build quality for the price.
We are really happy with the drive and amount of room in the Captiva Active (2016). I can easily fit two car seats and an adult in the back. Boot space is great and makes life with two kids so much easier. Petrol consumption isn't brilliant but isn't bad either. Average 11km per 100L. Love the Apple Car Play
We review a 2012 Captiva LX. Have a look if you are looking into this car! The car is a very good value for money vehicle. Lots of features, especially for the price. A bit cheap interior, slightly uncomfortable seats but the massively configurable interior allows it to actually be a very practical car.
The Captiva drives well but unfortunately my 2016 captive has a cooling problem and it blew the engine once, gone to the dealer twice because of overheating. The car is the worst thing i have ever experienced on a new car and general motors dont care about the customer service. Still the car is not running because of failure to diagnose the problem
Good family car. Bought it in used 2013 model. Drove few 100 k and noticed oil leaking. Under warranty from Dealer, going back asking for repair. Has anybody had the experience of dealing with dealers for repairs?I am not sure how he got the RWC, because I understand oil leaking would not pass RW test.
I thought I was buying a reliable top of the range SUV all wheel drive for long trips up and down the QLD coast, and for my wife doing night duty. I was sadly mistaken. Worst car I ever bought! I have had: parking sensors replaced twice, Battery went dead flat for no reason, Computer glitch shut down when driving, Fuel leaked out the filler whilst driving along and rattles galore. Depreciation - Bought for $37K (8 months ago) now worth $26K.
My captiva 2016 have some beeps alarm while when I driving on the road , the car say nothing wrong just only the beeps ? what's going on my car? It just happen my car just 2500km only 2 months and I got 1st service last month . The temperature coolant said 91 is it too high?
I bought my Holden Captiva in August 2009, I have a few problems, but nothing to really worry over, that was un til last travelling down the freeway last friday morning (02-09-2016). I was doing about 90klm when all of a sudden there was a griding noise then bang, and there was this big puff of white smoke and the car jerk to one side. I managed to get into the emergency lane and stop the car, applied the hazard lights, when I opened my drivers side door, there was this river of oil coming from under the car. I had the vehicle removed back to Bridgestone auto centre, from there we had a closer inspection and found that the piston had punched a hole of a large fist through the engine block, so now it is going to cost me $10K to get a new engine and get it back. This is from a car that only has 79347klms on the clock from brand new.
My Captiva CG11, 2011 model, purchased 2nd hand in 2011,with 36,000klms, now has 95,000k's . Last week the transmission failed, and it was replaced through the dealer under Holden warranty with a new transmission. This is apparently a common problem with the vehicle...anybody with this problem should have there mechanic contact Holden, before spending big dollars to replace....I also paid to have the rear engine seal replaced while they had it in....next problem, picked up 2 days ago after repair. After I drove it for a couple of hours, a warning light came on, I took it back to the service centre the following day, they tell me the rear catalytic converter needs replacement, around $1600. To coincidental for me, no mention of any issues previously, or when I picked it up after the transmission replacement. I'm currently seeking replacement under warranty. Other than these issues, the car has been a joy to drive, in all conditions, including Sydney to Perth & return. Around 11,000 kms all up.
I bought a brand new 2015 captiva auto. Heaps of room and lovely to drive. Has everything you need but no reversing camera. Thirsty on petrol. You'd be lucky to get 600klms out of the 60ltr tank. Haven't had any problems yet and have done 35000klms. Interior is very nice. Sunroof standard with this car. Browns Plains Holden have been excellent to deal with.
The Holden Captiva is the worst car I have owned &/or driven & maintained. Do not buy this heap of junk if you have any other options, please pursue. I have just spent three hours trying to loosen the oil filter to no avail. This is on top of everything else wrong with this crap design. Thanks god Holden is getting kicked out of Australia.
I bought it in 2012, it was a 2009 diesel model 7 seats. So far sa good. Just eat too much diesel, 10.7 L/ 100kms. Now , it is 147,000kms, I drive it everyday. It is ok. I changed tyres and betterys on time, I go to change oil on time.
I LOVE THE 2015 Captiva 7 LTZ it is a Beautifull Design and a Comfortable ride love the leather & gotta love the Heated front seats a cool bonus *should make all seats heated in future* I also love how the actual back of the seats in the middle (seats 3,4,5) can click back so if your a larger person you wont actually feel or look squished it does cut space in the back (seats 6,7) if you do this. clearly stating that this is a car for a family with kids 8 and under unless your a small family as the 2015 captiva 7 LTZ is a biggish smallish car these seat monouvers does actually Create a space difference which is good but if your a big family I would reccomend something much bigger. ★★★★★ 5 STARS FOR YOUS!!
Holden Captiva series 2 2012. 68000 km on car. Had no power and not changing out of first gear. Always had full sevices completed on car. I took the car to local transmission specialist and he informed me that my automatic transmission was totally stuffed!! Which will cost me upward of 5 thousand to fix. I was gobsmacked as most people dont have that much money lying around to fix it. $38000 dollars to purchase and now this. I emplore everyone!  Dont buy a Captiva.
We purchased our Captiva in 2012 - it only had about 7,000ks on the clock. Never had any trouble with it until now.  Yesterday I was driving along a highway and went to take off from traffic lights, there seemed to be no power and it jumped and then seemed to go along. Got to destination, parked the car, when I went to leave, it would not reverse.  It engaged in reverse, but would not reverse.  Had to get it towed and now they say we need to renew the transmission which is going to cost us an arm and a leg.  I am so disappointed and disgusted to think that this is the case. The dealer we got it from does not want to know about it.  The car has not even done 70,000 ks. I am never buying a Holden again and have always had them.
I think the Captiva looks good, the ride can be a bit hard when compare to my previous car which was a 2011 Holden Commodore. Engine is noisy to get going but once at speed is very quiet. Power is adequate. Cabin is very good, seats a little hard but still comfy. Love the Android Auto, it works great. Stereo is fantastic, my 16yo daughter loves the bass. I love the storage in the back of the 5 seater, lots of hidden compartments. Just took it for a 2 hour drive to Canberra and fuel economy was good on the highway, not so good just driving around. All said I think for the money it is very good value.
The car drive me crazy every day the engine light, Hilda light, airbags light and break light all playing funny, some times the airbags come sold light for a weeks than it is turn off it self then the engine come up for a months and turn off it self then booths come up. Never had a day without a light on last tow weeks I spend. 3 thousand dollar and the care still playing funny.
Car is OK has suffered loss of power for no reason.  just so everyone knows it is not the egr valve or the inlet manifold even though your lights say it is. You need to replace the intercooler pipe. Once l got this fixed was a good car also beware of the faiding black plastics
The Holden Captiva is nice to look at but that's all. Try adding oil, transmission fluid or changing the oil filter on the 2008 Captiva ($38,000) - it's ridiculous engineering. I use to like Holdens but not anymore. Glad they have left Australia because they rattle to bits. Go Mazda!
Such a shame to see so many negative reviews! I was apprehensive to buy our 2015 Holden Captiva7 LTZ but so glad we did. We have had absolutely no problems with this car and love everything about it. Its a great family car, very spacious, a breeze to drive, great value for money and mechanically excellent so far. I have heard that Holden has tried extremely hard to eradicate all mechanical faults etc pre 2014 and the models post 2014 have been much more reliable so perhaps that is the reason. All in all, I am proud to say I own this car and happy to give it a 5/5 review!
80,000km needed a brand new transmission for $6k. Wont be buying another Holden again which is disappointing but reality. The dirability is just not there. Other than the durability, no issues... but i think there is probably a trend amongst reviewers. Make a wise choice and get something else! Best of luck!!!
Love mine! Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate but mine is fab and I am so happy with my purchase. No worries, well maintained and no problems. Great on diesel, nice amount of power considering. Love the reverse camera and seat warmers. Love the look of it. Glad we got it
Great car, great value for money.I would like a tighter turning circle.Blue Tooth would have been nice.I've had mine for four years with no problems, the fuel consumption has started to go up just before a service and the no slip back has slightly started to slip.I don't drive very far and am way under the k's when the next service is due so I wonder why I need to service the car more than once a year.Felt a little unpatriotic when told my car was made in Korea.The Holden salesman put my name down incorrectly and ignored me when I wanted it changed so for years now I have received mail addressed to someone else - looking at a Toyota next.
I bought my first Capiva LX Diesel in Aug 2012. This car ran like a dream while being a little thirsty for a diesel. There were no warranty issues and I couldn't fault it. In June 2016 having paid out the balloon the previous year I was getting ready to reregister and going through the costs. At the same time I checked the Holden website and discovered that I could get a new LTZ Diesel with car mats window tinting roof bars to fit on the standard roof rails cargo cover towbar paint protection, interior protection and something called Schmick which lets me pay $50 to get the little dings taken out for five years, a 5 year warranty 3 years free service all on road for $42,000 with a $16000 trade in on my 4 year old Captiva LX. Faced with about $2000 for rego CTP a service and new brake pads for the first time I said YES. The new car is better than the old one so Holden obviously are keeping the improvements coming. Its quieter and with smother ride than the old one and a classy interior and standard equipment for the price. Considering I was looking at a Toyota Fortuner for $65000 I don't think anyone could show me a car that is better value. The Captiva isn't perfect but then I don't expect a jaguar type refinement for $41000 on road. I also like to spend as little time in a car as I can so for the trips across Sydney it is more than adequate. I'm not sure I would take it off road but then again my kids are in their 20's and I got my jollies 4WDriving in a Discovery and Pajero. The middle aged spread has set in and I don't want to pretend to be anything other than a reasonably affluent Northern Beaches middle aged man. My wife says that if my midlife crisis is a Captiva LTZ then that's fine by her.
I saved up and purchased a 2008 reg two and a half years ago.  Since purchasing there has been a constant burning smell and fan sound after running.I have had to replace the dpf, dpf sensor, glow plugs (mine had melted). The rear sensors no longer work, the rear door handle no longer works, nor does the digital clock, oh and a broken wire ensured the engine management light remained on which cost me a fortune in fault finding fees. The engine management light has now turned on again, so I have to call it a day.Due to all the exhaust system problems I can no longer afford to risk buying another diesal so can no longer tow my horse trailer. Thank you Chevrolet
Bought (new) a 2009 LX 7 Seat Diesel (top of range approx Aud$38,000) with many extras. We did approx 70,000 kms &sold 2016. It was the best sized vehicle for our needs.OK for the duration of the warranty, then required repairs to turbo, airbag module, centre display unit, ABS sensor, exhaust manifold, injectors, particle filter. I can't finds another couple of invoices, but repairs totalled $13,900.In 50 yrs of owning cars, I have never expected any to be trouble or repair free, but this Captiva would be the worst.We now need a replacement vehicle. Captiva still best sized-layout-handling car for us on the market, so back to Holden we went. Explained the above, hoping they may reassure us: "the new models have addressed issues etc" but oh-no. Not Holden. Saleswoman spoke with 'manager'. On return promptly ignored our issues & talked right over the top of us. As cash buyers she wanted to close the sale at all cost. You won't believe the trade in value either!I consider the car is very poor quality and Holden don't care about you.If you want to loose money, buy a Captiva.
We bought our 2015 Captiva active brand new in December last year. Now keeping in mind it's still relatively new it's been great for its value. With a trade in of Toyota Camry we picked it up for $24000. Alot of this review is based on value for money which I feel is great. The car drives smoother than the Camry. Being a front wheel drive the Camry you could feel every bump in the road through the wheel. The Captiva is really smooth. The fuel efficiency is not as advertised but still it's acceptable and around the same as the Camry both being 2.4l we left home on a holiday 380kms and it used half a tank fully loaded, my brothers new  Mitsubishi asx was slightly better but it's smaller than the Captiva. The aircon works great! I believe it was an issue in previous models but one day we drove around 80kms in 42 degree heat last summer and it was fine even in the back where there isn't any vents. Our Captiva  with the 2.4l petrol is slightly underpowered but not enough to become a problem. I feel hesitant to put my foot into it cos they like to rev really hard. The reason to this date I rate it 4 out of 5 is the one downside and that is the centre console vibrates and annoys the crap out of me. But hey for $24k and a 100000km old 06 Camry we walked away with a new 7 seater car, leather interior, sunroof, fog lights and bigger alloys I couldn't be happier at present. We also have free servicing till 2020 as part of the deal and that's why I chose to ignore the bad reviews here. I doubt I'll have it in 5 years as I am a mad Toyota man and if I had the money I would've went to Toyota. Guess that comes back to value for money and affordablity for young families.
Terrible turning point, drives like a truck, very noisy even when you switch it off, burning smell, air conditioning did not work properly, automatic transmission went at 100,000ks, oil leak, now the sensors for air flow & brakes are going costing over $400! The seat belt also needed replacing as faulty.  In summary the car is terrible and been nothing but trouble since I drove it out of the showroom as a brand new model!
I bought my 7 seater diesel new in 2010. Now done 114000 kms, changed the timing belt as per service schedule at 90k its been great to me.Left hand mirror indicator gone and its $160 to fix, I said no, 1 of the 3 mufflers went and holden wanted $600 I said no, had it changed for $120. Service costs was a rip off at holden I paid $700 for and oil change and safety check. Take them to small service agents, heaps cheaper.Currently looking at the new 2016 model but scared now reading all the reviews. Engine just a bit small.Also looking and new jeep but bad reviews there too.
Hi everybody, I do not own a Holden and just had a rental one for more than a month on my trip to NZ and thought it is still good to share my experience.I did not choose this car but the rental company did a free upgrade and I ended up with this Captiva.The car had done about 4000Km and it was quite new.It was a 2015 LT 5 seater version with a 2.4 engine.The car was very under powered and ECO mode was really bad.Transmission was very jerky and 2nd to 3rd was the worst.Power steering was making noise and the ride wasn't that comfortable.Fuel consumption was pretty bad as well, the best I could do was 12.8L per 100km which is more than my 10 year old 2.5 tones turbo Volvo.USB player could not change folder so I had to select random folder but wasn't good at all.Most of the time I was shifting gear manually to get the car going on hills and freeway but even using ECO mode wouldn't have saved me much on fuel.Over all I would never buy a Holden specially Captiva, it is a very horrible car, the one that I drove was only few months old, I don't know how this car would be in 3 years time.I have been a European car fan for all my life and been driven them for more than 20 years,having said that on my previous trip to NZ, 3 times I was given Hyundai  Santa Fe which were absolutely fantastic,so I am just saying that I am not against Japense,Korean or Australian/American cars.No wonder in Australia they call it Craptiva :).
First turbo went, then Transmission went a month after 3 year warranty ran out, power steering went, and now having battery problems. Seatbelts have stopped retracting and we've been advised its $800+ to have it fixed. This is a 3-year-old car! Salesperson sold us the lifetime servicing at $360 and now it's all of a sudden switched over to $480 for bigger services. Buy a ford, save yourself the hassle especially when they never have a hire car so I can get my 5 children around. A 5 seater cannot replace my 7 seater car.
So previously I had the holden captiva 07. I now have the Holden Captiva 11 auto diesel AWD 7 seater. Once again it is luxurious inside with leather seats and sun roof mag Alloy wheels GPS. So nice inside. Comfortably seats 5 and love the added 2 seats in the back for when I'm carting extra kids around. Not sure an adult would be comfortable back there though. It drives well and it has felt like a pretty safe car. I would like some recommendations on tyres for it though as I'm due for some new ones. I've had it from about 45000km which is practically new. I've done just over 13000km in less than 5 months. This is were it loses stars. It has began losing power while under normal driving conditions. I went to take my children to school and I got 5km up the road. I accelerated to about 50km and the power died. The car idles but no acceleration. I managed to "limp" the car the rest of the way to school then home again parked it and called a tow truck who took it back to the Holden dealership. Then the service department tell me they can't find a fault, so I ask them to do the 60000km service which they did. I get the car back and it seems fine until the next day I'm driving along in a 70km zone and I lose power again. Not happy. I've now worked out if I get the car going and coast along each time the power dies it comes back within seconds each time I can get the cars speed up. Not ideal but the service repair guys are telling me there's nothing wrong with it so what do I do. I've already spend 9 months of my life with the previous lemon now it seems I have another. I do not recommend these vehicles they are bloody dangerous. I will keep you updated with what happens with this one. But I can not recommend this car.
Purchased new and now has 16000ks on the clock. Misleading on fuel economy as we were informed it was very fuel efficient and performs to the stats provided.  Well it doesn't! I contacted holden and was told " it has to be run in " what a ridiculous statement!   15000ks later and nothing has changed, still rubbish fuel economy!   Always wondered too about the engine sound when it's cold started it makes a rattling sound (but thought nothing more of it as mechanically the car is fine so far no problems) and recently have had interior light issues where they just come on whilst driving indicating a door isn't closed properly but they are!  This is quite annoying when night driving.  Anyone else had this problem?  Will be contacting my dealer if this starts to become an ongoing problem as its still under warranty.  I was loving the car otherwise,  it's a great smooth quiet drive I have no issues with the interior it's comfortable enough I don't feel it's dated as some say.  My main annoyance is fuel economy as this was one thing I brought up upon my initial  purchase to the salesman, he assured me yep its great on fuel and theirs the stats (which were on front windscreen).  No going back for me but for anyone reading this just be aware.  Hopefully these are my only issues and I will keep it for the warranty period but after that I will look at purchasing something else and will steer clear of the beloved aussie holden (which isn't aussie anymore )  such a shame.
Well we have bought a 2015 Ltz 7 captiva we have had it a month and it now has to go into the garage (an hours drive away) for 4 days due to an oil leak and the engine has to be removed etc it has not even done fifteen thousand Ks what do we do any advice much appreciated, think we bought a lemon GUTTED
I was really worried when I bought this car 3 years ago as I read the reviews after I bought it. Maybe because I purchased the Series 2 I have been lucky, but the car has been great. No mechanical or electrical issues. All it has needed is servicing and a new battery. My only negative is the black trim on the outside of the car around the wheels and skirtings fades extremely quickly and its needs regular armoural to keep it looking new.
I am running it for 3 years now with 40,000km, very happy with it so far, hasn't had any small problem at all. Car floor is pretty low and makes to feel roomy. Really plenty of space to accommodate a family. Running pretty well with sufficient power. I especially like the seat fabric, it is not such a cheap clothes like nissan, easy to clean. The only downside to me is the towing capacity which is 1500kg, relatively less than competitors. Will never be able to get this grade 7 seater car less than $30k.

Unfortunately not a lot of good things we can say as we bought two 2011 Captiva's together as we got a the black and the sister got a silver one in 2012, both have had there share of problems LCD screens, major gearbox repairs, some electrical problems on both.However the black one has had exhaust issues and changed all the catalytic converters and a starter motor plus a fuel pump (due to combined filter with pump)All this has cost us a fortune especially the last half after the warrant finished, biggest headache ever for us.
Bought a new 2013 Captiva LX petrol v6 and started to have some concerns the same day we drove it out of the yard. I couldn't believe how much the engine had to rev to get it to reverse up a slight incline and how the car rocked side to side over uneven roads. Smooth, flat, open roads - fine, anything else was a challenge.  In the time we had it, it was recalled twice, and had to go back again for a loose rear door, and at 28,000kms, it had to have its steering rack replaced. Did I mention the unstable and firm ride and lack of get up and go. Gearbox seemed to be always in the wrong gear and couldn't make up its mind which gear to be in. Having read the respective forums, talking to service reps, (actually being warned by service reps) seeing how quickly the resale price dropped, and seeing the rows of captivas parked up at car sales yards, we had the opportunity to trade it in and be rid of it before it became a real problem. Am now happily driving a Territory Titanium SZ RWD 4.0 petrol. It's more economical, comfortable, drivable, versatile, and when you put your foot down the right things and sounds happen!! In fact, there's little real comparison between the two. Needless to say, lesson learned about the captiva and will not be buying a Holden any time soon. To cap it all off, when in another city I had booked a corolla hire car, only to be given a Holden trax.......brought back bad memories.
We have just done 40,000klms in our 2015 Captiva and very happy with it. We get it serviced as per log book and it hasn't had any problems, it still drives and handles like new and there are no rattles or mechanical issues.  I would definitely recommend a Captiva to any family looking for a reliable and versatile SUV.
No, it has had the suspension done twice, the oil leak is constant so much we slip over in the driveway. The engine has been replaced but turbo broken, air con needs a good ol' kick in the guts to get it going. Grey smoke when you accelerate. Back seats in the 7 seater feel like you are suffocating as the air con doesn't work to get back there. Tyres finish so quick maybe 20000 kms which costs a fortune. Terrible fuel economy. Really really bad.
I have a 2015 5 seat 2.4 Petrol Auto.Love driving it, plenty of space for the family.The suspension is quite firm, but it corners well for such a tall car. I'd say it has a European feel to its setup.Engine is okay, feels as though it needs to rev to produce the power, but the 6 speed auto lets it get up there quick enough. Not much engine noise inside.ECO mode is best for most driving, but in the hills or when towing, turn it off.Front and rear parking sensors love to beep. A lot. Front has a different sound to back, but no left/right effect which means you actually have to look where you're going. This is 2016, Holden.In-dash entertainment would disappoint even someone time travelling from 2010. No colour, reversing camera, app-link, sat-nav or even any sassy backchat about my music choices. But that has been sorted on the 2016 models.Fuel economy is worse than quoted (surprised?), but not by much. I'm getting 10-10.5 using unleaded 95/98.I avoided the diesel after all the horror stories about them eating themselves. Hopefully GM have sorted out the reliability - they included 5 years warranty and roadside assist which is either confidence or necessary.In summary, it's early days to comment on reliability, but I'm having great fun driving it.
Don't buy a Crapiva Unless you love stressing an love being told lies. Cost us 1000's an 1000s to fix, Even under Warranty It was a Very Stressful time, 8 weeks to fix, had to cancel our holidays cause our car was in Gosford Holden for months . My wife cried for months  #Lemon #Stressed out of our eye balls
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SUV!! BEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED!! The drive is amazing and full packed of features and extras. The sunroof is excellent with plenty of head room and love the leather seats! The interior is very well designed and the black looks extremely smart! Thank you Holden
This is the first and last Holden I will buy. I have Captiva5 8/12 build, 2.2 diesel, AWD work vehicle, 76,000Km.  All 4 window motors replaced twice, engine oil leaks, exhaust gas leak in turbo area, (I`m told this is normal, not when I was on the tools) EPF burns off every 6-700Km`s at a cost of 2-3 litres of fuel per burn. The ESC has an issue with left hand curves on dirt roads, the right hand front wheel grabs and the first time it happened at about 70k/h, I nearly rolled it. It has done it twice since but I am ready for it now. I complained to my local Darwin dealer to be told there was nothing wrong with it and I was charged for the privilege. The problem is in the programme I believe. I was told by Holden Customer Service that this is a Global car and the programme is written for ice and snow.  Therein lays the problem, we are a bit short on ice and snow in the Northern Territory!! It appears to be gaining engine oil between services, I blamed the dealer for over filling it but I now find that it could be diesel washing past the pistons during the EPF burn offs, How long before engine fails due to oil dilution ??  Alternatively do I reduce the time between services to maintain the oil quality and add to the operating cost of this vehicle?? It should be doing 70-80,000Km per year but with the problems it has had it has been left aside. Anytime warranty work needs to be done it can take over a week to book it in and then 2 weeks (at least) to get the parts, although I did get a rear quarter glass in 48hrs. I was told by the local Toyota dealer they would not trade it in on a new vehicle, they suggested I try for a private sale.As a comparison, I have had 4 Toyota Camrys over a 13 year period that have collectively travelled about 1.1 million kilometres without any work done to them aside from regular servicing, tyres and wheel alignments. I bought the Captiva as mine site visits were a bit hard on the Camrys although they never let me down.  I would like to be able to lower the driver`s seat vertically on the Captiva rather than just tilt the base up and down. I have short legs but the seat is OK in my work boots.On the up side; I get around 820Km`s per tank generally despite the EPF burn offs, it is comfortable on long runs, (3000Km`s in the first week, 15,000Km`s in the next 2 months). It is good in the bush (not a full on bush basher, but it was never intended to be) and handles the mud well.  This should be a good vehicle but the little frustrations put it down to the point where it gets overlooked most of the time.
Wow this car has been nothing but problems we have a 2011 7 seater and nothing but problems. We brought this car new and it has cost us so much money. We always have it serviced when needed but now been told the transmission has gone, only 4.5 years old. And it is going to cost us and arm and a leg. Guys please don't even thing about buying this car you will regret it. We even had wiring issues and when we took it to the service centre they tried to tell us a rat had got into our car and eaton the wire, needless to say they found out in the end it had not been wired correctly. We are forever buying new light globes as they don't last love. We had to replace the catalina conversion and so many other things I can't begin to name them. As soon as the transmission is done so is the car.. Time to count my losses and move on.
I bought my Holden Captiva brand new! Between my home town Holden service department and the car itself it was there at least once every 3 months with something wrong it! The last thing I got told by one of Holden Australia customer care consultants was " what do you want me to do about it" even though at that stage it was still under warranty!! NOT HAPPY
This horror car is 10 months old, it has only 3,500klms on the clock and has been serviced 6 times. Fuel efficiency ( or lack of ) for this 4 cylinder car has increased from 12.5 to a current 14.9 litres per 100 kms, which I am told by the receptionist at Newcastle City Holden service is quite acceptable and wait for it, this may even increase and she knows all there is to know about the Captiva, she is happy to tell you. It doesn't matter that the literature supplied to us by Holden for this model says something quite different! I have friends who own a 2012 6cylander Captiva  and their fuel consumption sits at 11.5 when I bring this to the attention of the receptionist of the service team because this is the only person you can talk to about this, I was told it's because my car is new and needs to be older than 12 months to have better fuel consumption, please can you believe this advice????This horror car not only has had issues with fuel consumption but also has problems with rear passenger door not opening, rear window not opening and tail lights not working. This is terrifying, every time I take my grandson in my car I don't know if I am going to be able to open the door to get him out or even wind his window down, Holden there is nothing "Genuine" about your product or your service you should be ashamed!!!!If you are thinking of purchasing a Holden, run, run as fast as you can and don't turn back. Any car is better than a Holden.I will be off loading this car asap, and will never buy Holden again!!!!!!!! I would sooner walk.
Have had a whirring noise since we bought it 2008 diesel sx Holden wouldn't help said there was nothing wrong now we've been told it may need a new gear box after we found an oil leak. Engine rattling against gearbox which has possibly caused a major problem. Lots of electrical probs that hasn't harmed performance of car (don't think) petrol gauge has decided not to work so another electrical prob - don't think we'd purchase another of this type.
The 2007 - 2011 Turbo Diesel's have a known manufacturing fault: rocker roller bearings of the engine split causing major engine failure ie: completely new engine required!  (my car was out of warranty).  I put a fully reconditioned engine in mine and sold it at auction at a $15,000 loss over 12months.  In the tiny town that I live in there are two more in at the mechanics, one of which has engine failure (I think it's a 2013 Model).
We bought our 2011 Craptiva in 2013. Fuel pump failure. Water pump failure and numerous recalls. Lights on the dash illuminating like a Christmas tree for no apparent reason. Numerous visits to Holden about other issues. Unnecessary vibrations etc. It went ok for a while until the 3 year warranty was up. Then the old issues starting rearing they're ugly head again. Holden at the time to be fair to them did fix the faults out of warranty but getting to that arrangement with them was like trying to draw blood from a stone. Again ran ok for a while then the starting motor went. $100's of dollars to replace with a genuine Holden part. 3 months later the starting motor went again. Back to to Holden. New starting motor installed at they're cost but guess what. 4 months later in the middle of nowhere it goes again. We take it back again to Holden and you can imagine not just the frustration but all the time wasted with the car almost in the Garage as much as it has been on the road. They tell us there has been yet another recall on the starting motor and the lead and nut from the motor which could cause a short and subsequent fire. We tell them we received no information about this but low and behold a few days later we receive a letter from them about the starting motor recall. We drop the car off to them. They then tell us it will be a couple of days before they can get the parts in and if we would like to come and get the car. Why would we pick up a car with the potential to catch fire. We pick it up after the works are complete. 2 days later we smell burning oil. Back to Holden. Now we're told the front seal is gone and the motor needs to be pulled out to repair. And quests what $1000s of dollars at our expense. I would not go anywhere near a Craptiva or any Holden Vehicle ever again. Built in the old Daewoo factory in South Korea. I'd rather pay more to have them built in Oz then deal with this again. Please avoid
Bought the cg 2015 captiva 7 diesel. Going like a dream up to 10000km no issues. Leather seats cleaned with glitz leather cleaner seats come up lovely and soft. Let idle after every trip for turbo cool down. Towing's a breeze and we go up mountain ranges every week, it chews up the hills. Comfortable to drive once broken in. Happy with so far.
Had a CG model, LX diesel, there was an inherent problem with the 'roller rockers' failing on this particular model and the car should have been recalled. Had the family on board when the engine 'let go' on a freeway whilst in the middle lane, a recipe for a serious accident'. The engine virtually had to be rebuilt, this coupled with numerous other problems and I got rid of the piece of rubbish. Holden wonder why sales of their models are down when they put their name to crap like this.
Had my Captiva 2011 for just under a year and cannot even begin to explain the amount of money and anxiety that has come with it. Power loss at 80kph, going into random limp mode, oil in the coolant system, touch display not responding at all, DO NOT BUY OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!Extended warranty has not covered ANY of the faults listed above and the service guys have just told me the oil problem and touch display alone will cost more than $8000. I have no way of paying this with 3 kids so feel at a lossYou just have to read a handful of reviews here to see how many problems these cars have. There really should be a class legal Action organised by everyone here. Disgusting!!
Bought the diesel cap 5 and found it great on fuel, lovely to drive. I find the fuel catalac thingy is always coming on and have to take it for a 80k drive to stop it. we put a nudge bar on front and that has upset the parking senses but otherwise happy for the price.
This car has to be the biggest heap of crap I have ever owned!Only owned it for less than two years and already the timing chain has gone on me, which is a major manufacturing defect with these vehicles. Taking Holden to court shortly over it as they refused to repair due to me buying it used and it being slightly out of the warranty period. Also the ECU light keeps coming on for minor issues that are difficult to rectify, but that don't affect the performance at all. As examples, one of these is the power to the alternator and another is the oil pressure sensor - even though it is working perfectly it still picks up a code!Performance wise this heap has no guts at all and really lacks in torque. It's a shame, because it looks good. However there is a reason they are so cheap.Let me repeat - this is the worst car you could ever own. Don't think that you can take a punt and hopefully get lucky - you won't.
I bought th this car last year but now it's not going well its slow run and this noise in the engine it's getting louder my husband change the oil every 6months.I don't know what happens to it I pay lots of money for this car but it not gonna last for the next 5 years
I bought it with 157000 km on the clock its been serviced by previous owner every 5000 km had a major service done on so the car is mint as. And i guess that's the only reason i bought it because its been very well looked after still drives like a dream and smell lole new. I guess with every car you have look after it there is no oil exist which last you 10k km after 5000 km inside the engine the oil start turn into black and the reason for that is because it create co2 and that starts to eat all the seals and will create problems I always drop the oil every 5000km in every car and never had any issue what so ever so i can only say this car is really nice to drive. We look after it just like previous owner.
My daughter bought the vehicle secondhand fully workshop tested Captiva 10 days ago with 90,000 Kms. At home I could hear a rattle sounding like a timing chain noise. Two mechanics checked and agreed on my suspicions. The dealer advised it was the AC compressor- replaced it only to have same noise. Cam-phasers are now being replaced by Holden. Hoping problem will be solved.
I have a 2006 CRAPTIVA that stalls at lights, when reversing out of driveway or even just driving down the road.  I thought it was a faulty wiring problem.  Went to Holden they tell me they have never heard of this issue.  I did research on the internet and found lots of people with similar problems.  I eventually was told by an auto electrician that the problem was the E10 fuel I was using and that I should not run E10 in this car.  I do not run E10 anymore and usually run 98 and don't have problems, unless I buy petrol from BP.  It also cause problems for my car.  The engine light remains on in my car now but I just keep driving it.  Now my car wont start, the starter motor winds over but it just wont fireup.  I'm told there is spark and compression but fuel is not getting to where it should.  Bloody CRAPTIVA would never buy one again.
Having purchased similar vehicle in 2012, when an offer came up, bought one for my son in Nov 2015. Good size vehicle with low running cost and spacious. Only wished it came with reverse camera. Smart style for a very reasonable price.  The rep at Rosebery was very patient with our negotiations.
I purchased a 2009 SX V6 petrol 7 Seat Captiva almost three months ago as a private sale from a lovely older couple. The car had just under 100,000 klms on the clock with full logbook history and was in excellent condition.  Since then I have had the car to the mechanic 5 times and have made several complaints to Holden who just say "we acknowledge there are some problems with Captivas"   First it was a leaking coolant tank. Then a starting problem every time I refuel the car won't start and the dashboard lights up like a Christmas tree.  Then the engine check light kept coming on and I replaced the oil pressure switch. Then ABS and park brake lights and engine light kept coming on. Long story short the mechanic told me the timing chain, crank sensor and another sensor are all stuffed and will cost at least $4,000 to fix. My mechanic is former Holden mechanic and knows the cars back to front and he is extremely honest. My question to Holden and anyone thinking of buying a Captiva is - why is a car of this age with 100,000 klms having so many problems? It is not unreasonable to start having these problems at 200-250,000klms but not at 100,000klms. I am a single income family with kids and can't absorb this cost. Today I had to cut my losses and trade the car for $8000 after paying $13,500 for it three months ago. You owe it to yourself not to buy one. To Holden I say there can only be one thing for people to do who have purchased your rubbish product. Class legal action!
I purchased my new Holden Captiva 5 at the end of August this year. Road noise is minimal, handling is great. Front and rear parking assist, no camera works great. No problems after running it in. Only thing I'm not 100% happy with is the information display screen, orange or black background, with either black or orange writing. Making it hard to see sometimes.
We bought our 2007 Captiva diesel CX model when we arrived in Australia from the UK in 2012, it only had 38,000 km,s on it when we bought it and seemed a really nice car at the time.However only a month after buying the car the fuel injection pump had to be replaced, in all fairness the local Holden dealer was really good and replaced everything at no cost to us.Since then the car has been really good, very comfortable to drive and has not missed a beat until at 170,000 km,s the rocker arms failed causing the engine to destroy itself.It broke down really far from home and was a huge problem to get the car back.Fortunately i am a heavy diesel mechanic and was able to diagnose the fault and repair the engine at a cost of only around $1000 for parts.I would advise anyone that has a Captiva to get rid of it immediately they seem to be nothing but problem cars and Holden does not want to help at all or address the problem.It turned out to be a hydraulic lifter sheared of on cylinder no 1 that caused the rocker arms to snap completely and damage the cam shaft and stop the engine and cause a lot of damage.
We have NO END of issues with our 2007 LX Diesel Captiva - from the auto electrics which began the minute we drove it out of the dealer (brand new) to an issue with the rocker bearings which resulted in a total engine rebuild at a cost of $5500 to fix.  Exactly 12 months later we took the car back in for a service with Holden and we are informed we now need to spend a further $8000 of a new fuel injector system.  Is this a joke Holden?  Sadly not for us.  It is very disturbing to read so many others have had similar issues and can only lead you to believe these cars were built faulty.  I would NEVER recommend a Holden Captiva to anyone.  In fact it would seem there is already a public awareness growing that these cars should be renamed called Craptiva's - not really a good legacy for a company as reputable as Holden.  Disgusted.
We bought a 2007 Diesel LX Captiva a year ago. Driving is pleasant on the highways, if a bit noisy from the diesel motor. Fuel consumption is OK for a big SUV and the 7 seats are reasonably comfortable.  But after a year, it started cutting out on us with the engine cutting out while driving, leaving us with no power steering and almost no brakes. Luckily it happened at low speed. Holden checked it and reset the computer, and sent it back.  On the way back, it cut out. It went back to Holden who "finally managed to fault it", and told us that it would cost $4500 fr replacing a fuel pumpo. We cannot wait to trade it as we feel completely unsafe. It has less than 100,000 km on the clock. Holden quality is exceptionally bad, and they seem to feel fess than nothing about putting death traps on the road.
I could write a book on the problems i have been having with this car constantly, one after another. Our car has been seen by 5 mechanics and neither can identify what the problem is! New fuel pump,regular on time services and new gear box and still the same problem everyday with it choking at lights,delay in reverse into drive  and so much more!
Bought a new captiva active a while a go, so far so good, reliable. I trade in my commodore with captiva so I can feel that the only issue that I have is the firm suspension, other than that all great, worth for the price and 2.4L engine is sufficient.
Biggest waste of money!After 85,000kms problem after problem - broken hoses, crackedManifold sluggish the list goes on! The 3 year extended warranty - read it carefully cause it won't cover half the problems your car l never ever buy another Holden ever! A week after purchase I regretted it! Biggest bucket of crap ever! Stick to a Toyota!
Bought a New 2011 LX 7 Seater 2.2 Diesel. Within 7 weeks while I was driving to work the engine made a loud explosion type of noise, and the car died in peak hour. 8 weeks later I had the car back but no explanation what the cause was. Promised a full report from Holden that never arrived. Only found out 2 years later (unofficially) it was a blown fuel pump! Hmmm not sure about that. Complained about transmission every second service for next 2 years about it shuddering violently when changing down gears. Each time they investigated, they said they could not find anything wrong.Finally after the 3rd year and running out of warranty by 2 months and 5,000 km, they decided there was a fault with the transmission. The next week the SatNav died. They did a service at the same they fixed the 2 previous mentioned items and found the Starter Motor was nearly burnt out and the Wiring Harness was also burnt out. Luckily they fixed it all under warranty. 2 weeks later a horrible grumbling noise started emitting from the engine at startup. This time it was the EGR and luckily this was also covered by an out of date warranty.1 week later the grumbling noise returned. Holden think it might be the engine belt but insist it is nothing to worry about. I've heard that one before too!At my next service they replaced the Pulley Tensioner (about $400) which fixed the noise.However 6 weeks later it has started to return again.After 4 years, and before the Pully Tensioner went again, I traded the car at a great loss but got something much more reliable. To our surprise the car went straight to the auctions due to (in the dealers own words) "The transmission was shot (again) and required a replacement, about $6,000." So the car was would have been sold to some poor unsuspecting sole.When working the car drives great but there are far too many problems for a modern vehicle.
I purchased the 2015 Cativa 7 LTZ new, it now has 4000klms on the clock. I have the petrol 6 cylinder and although it does use a bit of fuel it is an extremely comfy and reliable car. It has all the extras you could want and looks great. I would recommend this car too anyone. Fantastic car would but another. If your looking for a fantastic reliable SUV that offers great value for money then this is your car.
I have never had a problem with my 2012 Holden Captiva 5 CGII 2.2 turbo diesel automatic AWD. I tow my Jayco swan with it and as I have said no problems but I have chipped it so never get any turbo lag and better performance and cheap to run when towing.
Bought a new Series 2 Diesel Captiva 5 Dec 2011 - car always professionally serviced on time every time and with 2 young children, is driven carefully.  Have had no real problems other than having the engine out twice for engine oil leaks; and now last weekend while hundreds of km from home, transmission dumped all its oil out on arrival at our Hotel. No prior indication of any issue (no warning lights - noise, nil).  Travelled only an easy 70,000km.  Towed back to our local Holden dealer (NRMA premium care is worth every cent...) and have just been advised by the dealer that internal transmission bolts (crown wheel nuts) had worked loose and smashed the transmission casing (hence oil loss). Apparently, via numerous forums, it is yet another common Captiva issue.  Now a new transmission is required - cannot be repaired.  Car is just 10 months out of the 3 yr warranty of course - waiting to hear from Holden via dealer if they will cover it under the so called 'goodwill' warranty... Will see if the new ACL law is taking effect...  Do yourself a favour, just don't buy a Captiva - period!
Bought a 2012 Diesel 7 seat Captiva with 23,000km on the clock. It first broke down on day 2 of owning it, loosing power while on a highway and had to be towed back to the Holden Dealership we just bought it from. Since we have been without the car for days, weeks and even months at a time as it continually breaks down with varying issues. The computer has been replaced multiple times, wiring looms replaced, intake valve cracked, belt melted to the starter motor, 2 major oil leaks, the GPS entertainment unit has been replaced. It even stayed on and illuminated for a week straight even though the car was turned off and locked while we waited for parts, the rear window motor broke down, random dash warning lights popping up constantly, storage compartments won't stay closed, both headlights stopped working all of a sudden, interiors have snapped off. It drives like a tractor and with all the electrical and mechanical problems we have had we no longer feel safe driving it. The car is a lemon and has had around $15,000 worth of warranty repairs to date. Holden customer care are atrocious. I asked them at what point they consider a vehicle a lemon and they refused to answer saying it is a hyperthetical question and they believe as long as they fix each problem under warranty they have fulfilled their responsibility. We requested a refund or replacement from the Holden dealer and they have refused. We were so excited when we bought it thinking it represented great value for money with the 7 leather seats, sunroof and all the mod cons but it has been an absolute nightmare. I'll never buy a Holden again.
Handles well on the corners, but noisy on acceleration at speed. Lots of rattles in the interior, seat belts, centre console and privacy cover in boot rattles, so had to remove it. An annoying dial system on the dashboard controls, not user friendly. Very hard suspension so every bump in the road is felt. Would not buy another Captiva!! A positive would be good leg room and a spacious boot.
The vehicle doesn't get driven much (average 2 times a week, usually 15 minutes round trip) &, apart from the handbrake not releasing this morning - it eventually did, 3 hours later - this is usually a reliable vehicle. As with all new vehicles it is heavily reliant on its computer system which l believe may have caused this mornings issue.
After spending over $40,000 on a brand new captiva 7 LX... I was told within 6 months of its purchase that it's engine needed to be pulled out to address a leak. Giving Holden the benefit of the doubt...we had this done. Since then I have had the engine pulled out again and now on its 40k service...I have been advised this is required again.  How can a new car needs it's engine pulled out 3 times and for Holden to take no responsibility for this issue....poor service and attitude by Holden!!!
I brought a 2011 Captiva 7 3.0l v6 2 years ago and can honestly say it's been a great car, only problems I can pick with the car is a slight wind noise and high fuel consumption. I traded my previous v8 6.0l car in for this car and I think the v8 was better on fuel regardless of how they where both driven. The key to these cars is regular servicing.
I purchased a 2007 Captiva 12 months ago and had nothing but heartache with it. At 150,000km the whole motor had to be replaced after blowing up and leaving us stranded on the side of the highway. We have continuing issues with random warning lights appearing due to 'faulty wiring' and the fuel injectors cannot seem to keep up. The boot sensors and airbags are tempramental and the steering is just as dodgy. The timing belt likes to spontaneously slip, just to keep you on your toes also.  It has never felt safe or comfortable to drive, like a ticking time bomb really.... I would not wish this heap of junk on my worst enemy and would strongly advise anyone against even considering purchasing this vehicle.
So annoyed right now. We have had timing belt issues for a year now, the engine light ca,e on at about 90,000/4 years old. Holden reset the software and now 10 months later it is back on again and we are lookign at 5000 to repair a 5 year old 36,000 LEMON. And to make it worse, no other mechanic will touch it as it requires holden specific tools to do the job. We cant afford to fix this issue, but cant afford not to. Really feel like crying.
Brought the new Captiva 5 for my wife love it great car salesman was really helpful. I would recommend the car to a family who need a small  suv and who need a little more room. The petrol motor has plenty of power and the sunroof just tops the car off.
I am so disappointed after 9 months 14000 km and 7 attempts at correcting issues in this car it's time to say goodbye. The Dealership has agreed to replace this car as it is a heap. I loved the interior and they got the DVD player working but the dash lights never stopped playing up in it which means there was a major fault with the vehicle and after I lost all power while driving I sent it back to Dealership on a truck.  Bye Bye Lemon. I do not recommend this car to my worst enemy the stress of it all over the last 9 months was unbearable. Life is tough enough without the added pressure of cars that don't work as they are designed to!! Even for a used vehicle with such low Km's it should have had many years of life left in it and a good 300000 km for a diesel engine.  Most unreliable car I have ever owned. The customer service I have received so far can't be faulted. They attempted to fix it 6 times and now on the 7th time they know it's a lost cause and have been completely reasonable and are offering me a replacement vehicle. I won't be getting one of those again! If I try a newer model I will write another review.
Honestly the worst car we've ever owned.Purchased a Captiva LX 7 2011 just over twelve months ago from a Toyota dealership... got what we considered a good deal.Enjoyed 6 months of use until things started to go wrong.Engine light came on at about 90k and was told timing belts required replacing.... Shocked that a car less than 4 years old required a major service.  Booked it in as Holden decided to cover the cost.Two days prior to the service suffered a major transmission failure that required towing it an hour to the dealership...1 new transmission and timing belt change we were on our way.Two months later sat nav and heating control switches failed. Was advised it would cost $850 to repair.  Declined the 'Holden Goodwill' stating that at even 50%, $850 was still ridiculously expensive.Next month engine light re-appears and returned to Holden.  Engine seized on mechanics while taking it for a test drive... Was advised that Holden 'Good-Will' would cover the cost of the engine however we would be required to pay for the labor. $1000...  Obviously had no choice and they went ahead.Engine replacement took two weeks, after which we were advised that the transmission was now shuddering when changing gears and would need replacing..... again.Three weeks later was given car back with slack steering wheel which made it very disconcerting to drive.After having the car back for three weeks the engine light came back on and we returned to Holden once again to be told it was an oxygen sensor and something to do with the Catalytic converter... The error code had been cleared but they couldn't guarantee it won't return.Two days later..... engine light is back on.......... Have just traded the Craptiva in for a Toyota Kluger.  NEVER, EVER purchase a Captiva and if you have one, get rid of it before things start going wrong!!!!!!2 x transmission replacements1 x Engine replacement1 x timing belt replacement1 x failed satnav system1 x heater control switch failedin LESS that 12 months!
I took over payments on this car from my son. Bad mistake. It had a very noisy motor (petrol). Immediately I took it over, the timing belts had to be replaced at only 110,000, also at the time of purchase the cruise control became intermittent.  So did the climate control and fan/air cond and wipers. I've owned the car for 5 months.  Out of that time my mechanic's had it for 12 weeks total.His is a highly qualified workshop with 6 mechanics and 2 apprentices, and they can't sort it out though the shop has spent BIG time getting computers re ghosted etc etc etc. and studying systems.  They have consulted Holden dealers and they just shake their collective headsThe car was "worth" $8k when I took it over.  I've spent $5k getting it fixed (trying) and it STILL isn't working electrically. Mechanically it's A1, runs like a dream.The interior is beautiful.The elecrics are woeful. I'm going to trade it on a new car and try to cut my losses.  I will be surprised if I get any trade in at all. I couldn't honestly recommend a Captiva to anyone after my experience, it's been nothing short of a nightmare.  It LOOKS great, runs great but the electrics are a complete mess and even several qualified Auto Electricians can't advise us what to do to fix it .The next car will be ANYTHING but a Holden, and I've been a Holden man on and off for 50 years.I'm done with Holdens because of this vehicle experience.
I bought captiva 5 2.4 lt 2014 2 months ago now clock on 3000 km and no issue for 25k it is a good car. If you expect better performance u have to pay over 35k i had test drive with kia sportage before bought captiva and I felt I was driving truck which means no power I know captiva is not powerful car but at least u don't feel u drive truck. I will update my review
Smooth talking salesman and cheap price talked me into this car. Mechanics love it because yep, IT MAKES THEM RICH! Same problems as everyone  else, transmission, electrical,  then random power dropouts and utterly disgusting fuel economy! Finally it dropped its guts on a busy highway and I felt relieved that it was finally dead to tell the honest truth. Its unsafe for families! SHAME ON HOLDEN!
I am the original writer of a review "A Lot of Car for the Money" in April this year on this site. Since then, a lot has changed!. In late June, our Captiva spectacularly broke down on a busy suburban highway - sounded like a set of cutlery in the clothes dryer and the cabin began to fill with smoke - all this 4 days before we were due to go on a pre-booked driving holiday to Perth & SW WA. It had to be towed to the dealer, we had to hire a car for our holiday and, in the end, it was all very unpleasant.It seems not all diesel pumps are equal. We were never told this, but buying from one extremely common company (which happens to be on the main road near us, hence we used it) presents a danger to the health of your injectors. Two blew on our Captiva and the fuel test indicated "contamination" which was 0.027% water (yes, that is the tiny percentage) and, under the 26K lbs/sq inch pressure in the combustion chamber, that is enough to cause such a dramatic outcome. Without going into this chapter and verse, because it was "contaminated" fuel, the engine repair was not under warranty - 2 years into a 5 year deal! So, it was paid for by insurance, but not before we paid $400 excess, $60 for new fuel and quite a lot for the hire car - which was also not covered. The car is now running fine - better than ever - and we only buy our diesel from the company recommended by our dealership. What does the ICCC do about this? As much as they do about fuel prices I suppose.An expensive, stressful and unpleasant experience. The RAA (SA version of RACV, NRMA etc) were very helpful, but they have limited power in these situations. The dealership was supportive in its way, but clearly this has happened before and they keep their cards close to their chests.I doubt this is solely a Captiva problem (RAA agrees) but it is worth knowing.
Bought second hand with 70000+ kms and now has 120000 kms and no problems encountered. Have this for more than 3 years now. 9.5l for 100 kms. less than a tank consumed from Wagga to Sydney, thats 455kms. Drove around Tasmania for 15 days camping and back to Wagga - no problems at all. Plan to keep this SUV for the next 5 or more years for daily commute and camping. Also used this car to move a friend's stuffs like a sofa bed a bar fridge, a small table from sydney and was amazed it can handle that much load. Also bought a marble table with four chairs from tasmania plus our camping gears and still fitted in. I love this SUV!
Purchased our LTZ diesel captiva one month ago as a demo with 5621k's. Tonight the oil light came on, pulled over and the Mrs checked the oil and it was bone dry. how does this happen?Sump plug in and no visible leaks underneath the body or under the bonnet. So I ask myself if the safety check was completed accurately when the card was delivered. I can see no possible way the car can use this amount of oil in four weeks!
I bought the 2012 captiva in 2014. It had 44000 km on it. All was brilliant til July 2015 at 50100 kms the transmission blew. It was going to cost $8000 to get a new transmission. My new car warranty had run out. My mechanic told Holden the problem and they have agreed to fix it under good will warranty. Not to happy about this I spent a lot of money on this car and it seems like a bucket of crap
I had a 2007 Captiva 3.2l petrol model which when using regular unleaded got on average 425Km for 58ltr petrol. When I used the higher octane petrol I got an additional 100Km (total 525Km) for the 58ltr refill.I bought new August 2014 a Captiva LTZ 3.2ltr petrol model which last refill took 58ltr of high octane petrol for a return of 308Km. First service last year I asked Holden to check the fuel consumption which they advised all was in order. Both these vehicles are sparingly driven. The 2014 model is just 12 months old and has done only 5,500Km. I live in Darwin so most driving is non-stop as we don't even have a rush 1/2 hour in the morning or afternoon. Whilst my company pays for the fuel it is still an absolute outrage that the Craptive delivers such very poor mileage per litre. I would never ever recommend to even my worst enemy, that they purchase a Captiva of any sorts whatsoever. This lack of fuel economy, and total apathy by Holden needs to be investigated by the ACCC
I purchased Holden Captiva LTZ 3 months ago and I was told this car would run around 10L/100. During these 3 months of driving this car I hasn't run anything more than 400 in a tank and that was even when I drove it to great ocean road. Normally it only runs 360-380 Kms in 60Litres. Also it drives so sluggish that you see everyone overtaking you and this car is struggling. I have been making complaints with Holden support and after there testing and investigations - it is normal for the car to drive. NOT SURE WHY THEY ADVERTISE IT AS 10l/100km. Cant wait to get rid of it.
Bought a 2012 Captiva LX Deisel in March this year and added a full manufacturers warranty as part of the deal. The car was perfect until 2 weeks ago. First starter motor failure. Got that fixed and just this week the new starter motor failed. This was a GM genuine part fitted. Find out today that the original battery lead in the Captiva is substandard and contributes to the damage to the starter motor. When Holden were contacted by my mechanic to help solve the problem they new the answer straight away.Come on Holden, if the Captiva has an inferior part tell people and get it fixed.
Bought Captiva 5 April 2015. Never had a new car that is a lemon. Traded in from a Cruze which was much better. Left lights stay on at night and no automatic indoor light. But worse. No auto child lock so my son has opened the door several times while driving at speed. So no automatic child lock. Also bad back seat planning as his toe was caught in the door when closed. Guzzles petrol. Dashboard/display went on the brink - Holden dealer gave us a number and said go fix it yourself. Wont return our calls. Poor braking. Drivers seat uncomfortable. Drives ok on open roads. Unheard of in a new car
We have (still) a 2008 Captiva diesel - never had a problem until it hit 112,000kms (November 2014) - then knock knock knock one morning - so off to the mechanics, he thought it may have been a crankshaft bearing - but no - worse, the camshaft had worn and all the roller bearings had collapsed, rockers had worn (I saw the evidence - I have a great mechanic), when he rung the holden people - "oh its a common thing, I'll send you the kit" - Crap !!! holden - common problem!!, yeah wasn't happy, So yeah other than that - great car - returns 9.1 L/100kms on the highway....would be nice to recover some of the cost from Holden though - since "its a common thing"
Purchased a 2012 Holden Captiva 7 SX 2.2L Diesel model in 2012 because it was the best option in the $30,000-$40,000 range, and what a mistake it turned out to be. Worst car we have ever owned.Things started out great, we got the additional sunroof and side step for free as well as an extended warranty until 2018 and with it being a 7 seater, what could possibly be wrong...right? Wrong.Since then, this car has been back into the service centre in between 15-20 times. First indication came after a few months of purchase when we received a letter stating that Holden had done a recall on all Captiva as they found a fault. Fair enough, back it went for the repairs. The repair took 3 days. Finally got it back and then a few months later again another recall letter. They found ANOTHER fault with the Captiva line and back it went for repairs. This time 6 days. BIG replacement was needed apparently. Since then no recalls, but we've had to take the car into the service centre countless amount of time due to problems we've spotted ourselves. The car has been well maintained and serviced on time so these problems shouldn't arise, but they do. And the reason for that is because Holden have used the cheapest and crappiest parts available to put together a joke of a car. If we hadn't got the extended warranty, we would be down at least $10,000 or more in repairs. If you are in the market for a SUV with possibly either 5 seats or 7 seats, AVOID THE HOLDEN CAPTIVA!!!! Don't make the same mistake we made! Spend an extra few thousand dollars and switch to a better manufacturer! It will save you countless amounts of headaches and won't give you a headache!I can't even trust this car anymore to go anywhere.
We purchased a new 2014 Captiva 5 last year for the wife, good car for running around with room for two high school boys and friends. Basic options but perfect for the role it does considering the 5 star ancap, the posted fuel consumption combined is dubious. The car is using way over the nominated combined fuel by roughly 5 litres per hundred ( we purchased the petrol) I am finding this is a common thread for this model.
I bought a brand new Holden captiva 7 seater in 2010, this is our family car and in less then 5 years engine failed. It is costing us $9000 to clean the engine on top of the loan of $44500. Our mechanic send us the pictures of the engine and I can't describe the deposits of carbon in the engine, timing chains gone and sludge chockablock all over the engine. according to my research this is an ongoing problem with Holden Captiva, I didn't expect such a loss and trusted your brand.  I just want my money back.
Purchased used 2010 Captiva 5 Auto Petrol in 2012 from Beecham Holden, Caboolture - just traded this car on a 2015 Toyota Rav4. Have always owned & driven Holdens but because of rip offs & Zero after sales at Beecham Holden, will never ever buy another Holden.  The Captiva was ridiculous on fuel consumption, I believe it had a fault but Beecham were not interested in helping me, told me to take it to a Holden dealer closer to where I live.  Would not let me read Finance paperwork before I signed & ended up with St George Finance @ 10.52% - by the time we paid out our St George loan, we ended up with a Trade In of $2,000 & the Captiva had cost us nearly $34,000 - only had 61,000 km on clock @ trade but the Captiva 5 Petrol has a bad reputation & so couldn't get a decent trade in & couldn't sell privately.  All because of one bad experience with a very dishonest & rude Holden dealership, remember Beecham Holden @ Caboolture, it is goodbye Holden & hello Toyota forever for me.  I contacted Holden HQ to complain about Beecham dealership but HQ not interested - I was told each dealership is owned privately - fair enough but surely Holden should be concerned about who is selling Holden vehicles & unhappy Holden owners - GOODBYE HOLDEN
Could not imagine driving anything other than an SUV. Petite size, Looks good on the road. Handles well.The main negative is the turning circle. Probably the worst of any car we have owned. We will get the headlamps checked as they may not be positioned properly. Seems to be a black spot. I wouldn't bother with diesel again.Definitely not the fuel consumption promised and no advantage for us with diesel. Aside from that we love the Captiva.
I had the Diesel engine 2007 Captiva for 5 years Had two times pump replaced wiring issue which blows head lamp again and again also Had major expense for engine rollers gone fixed Newcastle holden for 5k now I have engine leaks problem not worth buying I have heard after the 2011 model they made significant changes
Purchased captiva 2012 deisel mid 2014. Had only 23000 on the clock and 1 year of new car warranty remaining at time I purchased. I drove for approx 20000kms and in april 2015, malfunction and engine reduced power lights occurred due to problem with DPF (deisel particular filter). Put in for 'fix' covered under warranty only after insisting I'm not responsible for fault. June 2015, Went on road trip with elderly mother going to longreach. Got to rockhampton (from Brisbane) same malfunction lights and engine reduced power light as well.  Put in again for fix, set out again next day for longreach, got 100metres up the road and again same malfunction. Can't rely on this car and don't trust to drive any distance. I'm full time carer for mother so need a reliable vehicle. Best Holden will offer at this point in time is a depreciated trade value. Disgusting. Still fighting for replacement vehicle to same value as I paid.  Had car for less than a year and has failed dismally, as had Holden customer care.
My list of wrongs is as long as the next bloke. Nothing but trouble from day one not to mention the run around given by the dealer as well as Holden Head Office. We only have one car for a family of 6. I work shift work & was often absent from work due to no transport. Aesthetically it looks really good, but mechanically it's a lemon. Constant oil leaks, lights flashing on the dasboard then disappearing, windscreen wipers coming on & staying on randomly, not to mention now only getting 400km per tank when previously it was closer to 600km. I hope this class action lawsuit gets going. I was offered $6000 trade in on a 2010 diesel model (in 2013) that all up cost me over $40 000. Not to mention $10 000 in repairs. Shame on you Holden give your customers what they deserve.....a refund.
We are a family of 6. Getting everyone in is fine. The car has given no problems at all in having to replace or fix things, except to replace air conditioning hose, over the 6 years we have owned her. Roomy, good on fuel (she's a diesel) reliable and a joy to drive. However, we have not taken her rough 4wd, only on the beach and through paddocks. Great, wonderful car.
Bought a Holden Captiva 7 LTZ series diesel in march 2015. Oil leak in 1000 km , been in contact with Holden, the oil leak is a known problem. Parts have to be replaced that requires the engine on the diesel models to be taken out. Never purchasing a Holden again.

I have a 2012 Captiva diesel LX. The engine has been out 3 times and continuous oil leaks. It is currently getting its second transmission. Warranty is up in July and I can't risk keeping it. The interior and fittings are all great but the engine and running gear the worst, I would never recommend anyone to get one.
I purchased the diesel 2012 lx 7 seater turbo Captiva. It drives very smoothly. The bottom line is yes it is a great value vehicle but I will hope it keeps HOLDEN together.5 years old and time for an update. Bought another brand- toyota. Guess what, i am missing my captiva. I think it was great value 7 seater on the market for what options you get in it. Holden have also announced 7 year warranty on the whole rang now. It was a great car to me and was easy to sell. Hope this was useful information for future buyers.
Purchased 2013 Holden Captive 7  diesel LX second hand (30,000 kls) November 2014  still under 5 year warranty from a local Isuzu/Hyundai dealer in Nowra, When I informed Country motor company (the purchase dealer) about the oil leak he arranged for the Captiva to be taken to the local Holden dealer in Nowra who promptly arranged for the new seal to be installed under warranty. Left the car with Holden ( loan car supplied by car dealer), 3 days, job done as per TL2551-1501 instruction from GMH. Given full detailed list of work performed, Brilliant service, cant fault both Isuzu Dealer & Nowra City Holden. I traded a Berlina Wagon for the Captiva, very happy with economy and ease of driving, with capped price car servicing an added bonus. I tow a boat all over the state fishing and camping with the family and the Captiva takes it all in its stride and backs up for more, couldn't be happier.
I bought captiva ltz last year (25/06/2014).I think this car is worst car in nz as following reasons:- continuously have some problems : noise, fuel gauge, petrol smell, navigation,  and others.- fixed 6 times by holden services, but still have a problem.- 7th a/s booking : 13/04/2015 (monday)- the engine suddenly stopped while driving on the motorway by fuel gauge problem. It was extremly dangerous situation.- this fuel gauge problem fixed 2 times by holden services, but still have same problem.- reversing camera is very poor(black & white) : worst camera ever I seen- navigation is not good :some area is wrong- fuel consumption : 11.4/100km- 03/02/15 found engine oil warning message: add engine oil- this car have no problem after 7th a/s (27/05/2015)* english is my second lanuage
We paid $35000 for a new 2008 diesel CX. Captiva  for its people carrying capacity and so called fuel economy. Fuel economy has been woeful all its life ( high 9's on the open road, 14ltr/100km + for city driving),even though the Holden dealer said it would improve once the motor "settles in". Anyway,the car met our needs, we continually replaced the scrubbed out front tyres even after numerous wheel alignments, but no major faults. At 88500km, and no longer in warranty, a rocker roller fractured in the motor, basically destroying it. The car had been serviced regularly, and had even been inspected by the Holden dealer 2 weeks prior to the fail. Holden customer assist told me to deal with my local Holden service centre who had been servicing the car but not their problem because car is out of warranty. I called the dealer who sold me the car but because I hadn't serviced the car with them, not our problem either. Holden "goodwill" say it is not their problem because car is out of warranty. Consumer affairs says its up to me to prove the motor failed under general wear and tear, and not mis-use. So I'm now left to decide whether to spend a quoted $10000 for a new motor, $5000+ for a 2nd hand motor or a patch up job for an unknown amount. All this for a car if it was running, is now only valued at $7500!!!!!!. I'm still contemplating what the Holden mechanic said," Insure it to the max, then push it off a cliff !"An expensive lesson learnt in warranty, servicing and buying crappy rebadged Korean cars.
Good suv. Only problem was that my wife kept jump starting helping other people.The new cars are not designed for it, which led new replacing new computer which cost me $1000.00 $700 for chip and $300 for labour. Good tip never do quick starts and turn it off all the time. I did it a couple of times when had to mow my lawns, what happen was I made the timing go out and taken 5 minutes of endless starting to restart the motor. My fault as it say in manual, Which made the cam belt shift which made engine light stay on. But engine was running fine. Holden nz said "should be fine take in on next service" . Did that runs sweet as since they install the new program to lower the senses. Its been good for 3 years now. Brought it at 117000km.
I bought a 2012 captiva 7 lx at auction in February. In April I went to start it one day but no go. Towed to dealership and starter motor and alternator replaced under warranty. 11 June the same thing, starter motor replaced again. The very next day after collecting from the dealership, and having started a driving holiday, the same thing has happened and once again towed to a dealership, only this time I am 500km's from home and even more annoyed. The dealership in Holbrook had it for five days, and reccomended to me that I not continue on but drive home, I then had to have it booked in at another dealership who replaced the battery, starter motor, and battery cable lead.I don't like the sat nav, or the instrument panel. I have owned Holden Commodores before and been very happy, I will never buy another Captiva again.May 27 2015 i am soo happy, i traded in my Captiva and now own a Toyota Prado.
We purchased a 2015 Captiva LS ACTIVE MY15 2.4L last month. We were told that the fuel consumption compared to the diesel car isn't much difference but it's an alcoholic on fuel, but that's car dealers for you. It lacks power with high and loud revs. We're stuck with it for 6 years but happy that it's got 6 years warranty and 6 years roadside assistance. I'm grateful because it's better than having nothing. I'll update it at a later stage if anything else happens.
Have had a 2008 SX Captiva from new. Brilliant diesel engine that hasn't cost much to service as some forums suggest, totally reliable and am still on the same brakes.  Great performance and economy. Mainly city work, bit off roading-brilliant. Beat my mates Prado and Hilux on soft sand...they got bogged and I drove past them, three times.
Reading all the poor reviews on Captiva makes me wonder how we have escaped all those issues. We bought our 3.2 litre petrol 2006 SX in May 2012 with 133000 km.  The car has now travelled  204,000 km.  In the three years we have had the car we have replaced the throttle body, battery and alternator. The brake pads are still those fitted when we bought the car. New rear tyres fitted by the dealer were replaced at 65000km. The other tyres have travelled almost as far and have about 5000 left in them. We have had none of the tyre scrubbing issues mentioned. A recent trip from Newcastle to Marcoola and back averaged 9.7l/100 km.The car is thirsty around town but it has given excellent service. Despite its high mileage the engine and transmission are very smooth and quiet.
Bought a 2012 captiva 5. My other half loved the height and view out of it so I was willing to compromise as it was her daily driver not mine. Within a couple of months it was at the dealership trying to get a constant rattle in the dash fixed- it went back another two times before we gave up and just put up with it. Unfortunately if it looks too good to be true it usually is and it certainly is the case with the captivas as you get what you pay for. Interior fit and finish is amazingly bad and cheap- the car never felt new as it always rattled or creaked, couple that with it being gruntless and thirsty. We got rid of it before we started getting any major problems and wouldn't buy another korean made holden again.
Purchased brand new October 2009, have replaced the battery 3 times all b4 I'd hit 85,000kms, 4 sets of tyres, breaks failed when I was pregnant and has my 4 kids in the car on the highway. Holden charged to fix turned out to b a recall won't tefund me. 2 days b4 Xmas 2014 engine light came on 94,000km on clock, I'm now up for a new engine, timing chains gone n sludge chocoblock in the engine. So disappointed still paying the pc of crap off for another 18 months once engine done it's cost me around $8000 since Dec 2014 and it's worth nothing. I truly believed in holden and thought Id bought a car that wld last a long time. It's just gone 5 years old ext warranty ended 2 months b4 engine light came on, not good enuf Holden I want my money back. Once finance paid the stupid car will cost me around $53,000 and it will b worth no more than $10k if I'm lucky. Lastly the service from the dealership once I drove my new car out of their lot was pathetic, cldnt care less about us and always passed the buck when I questioned issues
Where to start with the Captiva?  We have spent so much money on this car.  The upkeep is just insane.  I will start with the tyres.  To be honest I have lost count of how many times we have had to replace tyres.  They wear on the inside so half the tyre is ok and the other half can be down to the wire if you are not checking them.  Of course they are a special size so very expensive to replace.  The light bulbs are constantly blowing and at the moment we need to book our car in yet again to auto electrician as the indicators are not working again and the sockets and the fuses need to be fixed.  More money...Our big expense was just recently when we had to get the turbo and catalytic converter replaced at cost of nearly $5,000.  This was cheap too as the mechanic who did this for us gave us a good price.  Holden were going to charge double and after 3 times being at Holden they did not even know what was wrong with it.  Performance - It's diesel so a little it's slow of the mark as anyone with a diesel will know.  I don't know that we are saving any money by having the diesel given the price of diesel and how often we still seem to fill up.  We get about 400-500 klms to the tank depending on what kind of driving we are doing eg town vs country.  It has a really small turning circle.  It does have 3 anchor points in the back so if you need 3 car seats in the back seat (which can be done but it's tight) you have the points.Overall I would never buy a Captiva again or a Holden for that matter.  We are aiming to now trade up to a Mazda but giving the cost we are stuck with the Captiva for a while yet.  If you are looking for a 7 seat SUV do you research and be sure you know exactly what you are in for.  My advice stay well away from the Captiva.
....We have owned this car for 5 weeks and it has been problems from day one , anyone that has one of these will know by now the Sat Nav is a total have, it is many years out of date and is useless, all attempts with the dealer to update this to its current status..eg... a 2014 model same as car is not having any effect, we were sent a software update that is at least 4 -5 years old, so you pay approx. an extra $6,000 for a useless Sat Nav, this will seriously effect any re sale, the leather on the seats is already severely creased, the interior panels scuff up and you cannot remove the scuffs.We have tried and so has a professional valet service, this car has only done 3,000 k and looks far older now it already has rattles in the back, yet to discover where from, the advertised 10.1 fuel economy is far from correct and we have taken it out of town on a long run and this did not sort it, they say it now needs more mileage to sort it out, the parking sensors that work intermittently drive you nuts when they do work, most times they don't work, and every time you start the car you have to accept the terms and cond on the Sat Nav and they say you cant fix this, the so called carpet is just a felt type not a proper carpet and we bought Holden mats and the back mats don't appear to be for this car as they are way too small, we would never buy a Holden again, there is NO service or pride from Holden Australia...and we are both aussies and that sucks
See the update below before you buy;Great car with some minor issues. Sat NAV - the maps are very out of date & when I called the dealership to ask them when my 1 week old cars maps were out of date they blame Whereis who provides the map. I was told there would be an update next year & I would be charged in the vicinity of $350 to update it. Currently waiting on a reply from customer service in relation to this issue. The other issue is fuel economy - using heaps at the moment (unleaded) but I only have 700km on the clock so hopefully this will calm down.**Update at 9 months old & 9000kmFuel economy is terrible, can't get it under 12.5L/100km. Lucky to get 400km per tank on either highway or around town.I keep getting the same response from Holden that it may calm down. It clearly says on its web site and brochures that the average will be 10L/100km. The GPS is pathetic with the maps appear to be about 2 years old. I asked Holden about this & they basically said an update will come out when it comes out & we will charge you $300+ for your troubles. At 7000km it shut itself down & put itself into limp mode while travelling at 110km/h on a freeway. Holden's response was a shrug of the shoulders & a computer reset.I'm not happy with it & would have sold it by now if it wasn't leased. Will not be buying another Holden.
I purchased the Captive Series II 7 LX Diesel and I must admit I love this car. The front seats are very room and comfortable. The  full tank diesel runs me from Epping to Melbourne CBD and back for 7 days before it requires a refuel at $70 each fill. LED screen is brilliant when it is working (I've had to get it replaced *free due to it malfunctioning. Plenty of power, high ride, good viewining. Reverse camera is brilliant and necessary. If required the seats fold back to allow for even more room (it's huge). The biggest problem I have is the climate control, there are no air vents in the back seats/cabin. Also my IPod connectivity didn't work have had to use usb stick which works ok. The turning circle is terrible, I've had to become very proficient in 3 point turning.
Bought a 2013 7 LX and can't be happier with it. Driving experience is excellent and features are just the cherry on top of the cake.
I purchased my LTZ MY14 Captiva 7 in January from my local, well-known Holden dealer brand new. I love it. The car itself is really good. Comfy to travel in over longer distance and plenty of room for the kids. I love how the 3rd row of seats are split fold as often only have 6 in the car and this allows us room to put the shopping in comfortable. My only thing at the moment which I am questioning is the fuel economy. I have the petrol model and I'm lucky if i can get 300kms out of 3/4 tank of fuel. This doesn't seem right especially as the car has just over 8000s on the clock. My dad has just purchased a diesel MY15 LTZ and his economy is incredibly better than mine. If you are in the market I would recommend the diesel model even though it's dearer to service.
Took delivery of the vehicle on 9th of May 2015. Driven about 100km. So far very happy with the vehicle. After reading so many negative review, I was bit worried about the SUV, hence I am planning to update regularly. Middle seat is bit squashed after putting a child seats. Surprisingly the engine noise was low for a diesel SUV. Performance is OK, but I have not pushed the vehicle yet.So far me and kids loving the car.
This car so far has exceeded my expectations with regard to fuel economy and performance.  Bought it in February brand new.  Holden Captiva LTZ MY14 Diesel Turbo Auto 7 seater AWD SUV.  My husband purchased from Walkinshaw an Imscher ECU upgrade for around $700.  My god the difference in power, I just love it.  One strange thing happened the other day which I will let Holden know on the 3000km service.  I would have given 5 stars except how can I when it has a minor leak.  When I say leak, it's about every second day there is a a drop of oil on the garage floor.  I am hoping that this leak is permanently fixed after the 3000km service.  i will let you all know how it all goes.October 24th 2016 Update: 2014 Captiva LTZ DieselFurther to my review over a year ago where I had an oil leak I can come back here and say that since it was fixed in the very first month I have had no further leaks.I can honestly say with hand on heart that my Captiva has not given me any problems since then.  It has been a joy to drive.  It runs smoothly and economically. 10 stars!!!!
Hi. Purchased car new in 2012.Engine/cross member removed twice.Torque converter replaced for surging issues but still present. Power steering issues that almost caused an accident.Seat rail worn in less than 35000km Goes ok with 400nm torque when running well.Steering/suspension components came loose prior to 3000km service. Lots more issues to many to recall. Car is dangerous and Holden's "customer care" don't help resolve our complaints and concerns for our safety.
First week it smelled like something was burning coming from left hand side and we saw under the car on the left hand side a burnt cable which we told the dealership and they said all ok. Within one year twice they replaced starter motor and all cabling which costed me $5000 as I was away during holiday trip, Then power steering oil was drained due to lose connection. And now transmission is playing up as when I accelerate the revs go up but the car does not go. It is still under warranty but what will happen after the warranty runs out as the problems keep accumulating. I just came home with the tow truck in the middle of the night and nearly gave my wife a heart attack and she is disabled and I have three children now we have no car to drive. I am going to complain to Holden and if not resolved than I will complain to the ombudsman.
We purchased a 2012 Captiva SX 2.4L petrol brand new. We wished for a car that had a better fuel economy than the Falcon that we had, and an easier to use boot space. We looked at the diesel options and discussed these with the sales assistant, however with the fuel efficiency that was advertised for the petrol model, it didn't make sense to pay the extra for the diesel. I realised that this was only a 2.4L engine and I wouldn't be winning any races, but was fine with this. I was over the moon initially as I had loved the look of these cars. Straight away you could see the fuel economy wasn't going to be what they have advertised. I put this down to the engine needing to be ran in. I have now had this car for 2.5 years and still getting 14L/100km! Not ethanol fuel. Slightly better with 95 octane but evens out with the extra cost. I did ask the service crew if they could check if anything could be wrong because I couldn't seem to get anywhere near the fuel economy of 9L/100km advertised. He said there was no way I was going to get that fuel economy in that car, 'its only a 2.4L engine with that big heavy car'. Needs more air conditioning vents. It seems absurd to me that a car with 7 possible seats could only have air conditioning in the front row. My daughter sweats all through summer and sometimes even in the winter.  We are now looking at getting rid of it for something else but with a trade in quote last week from Holden of $14-$16k we might be stuck with it a while longer. He did note that the new captivas are extremely good on fuel at 9L/100km...Also have had problems with radio system (fully replaced as well as steering wheel controls), AC controls replaced, knocking in engine and doesn't handle well in the wet especially on the freeway. I definitely like the boot space though!
We have a Holden captiva LX Diesel 2008 model,The heater and aircon packed it in , in the middle of summer , car was so hot driving it we nearly passed out no good for our small children, now the rockers have failed its going to cost thousands in repairs, Holden new about there design fault, with the diesel motors not happy will be going to VCAT
Well, it seems I am not the only one with a Captiva that has major issues.  My 2006 brand new Captiva was serviced regularly and on time, but still had uneven tyre wear, the dash board lights would light up regularly and stay that way for days on end, the petrol tank indicator would tell me that the tank was empty when in fact it was full and the car's down hill braking system would come on randomly (not good when travelling at higher speeds!).  At 45,000kms the fuel injectors had to be replaced, at 61,000km the fuel pump failed and then at 101,000km the engine light came on and Holden said that the engine would have to be completely rebuit at a cost of $8,000 or a second hand engine put in the car at around $6,000 and labour costs on top of that.
Bought a CX Diesel brand new in 2010.  We are celebrating this week because we have traded it in.  If you are looking at buying one of these don't believe what they tell you regarding fuel consumption.  15 L for the 100 is what you should expect.  Other issues over the years include the Battery we went through 4 and they are about $300 each, tyres wear out faster than any other car I have owned,  electrical issues, break pads wear out very quickly.  Motor can also sound like it's straining when it goes past 60 km.  I tested a number of SUV's before purchasing and thought the drive and feel of the car was better than Dodge Journey and Territory but poor compared to the Toyota and Reno Koleos. On first impressions the car appears to be great value, however when you take into account the above issues it is anything but.
Probably wasn't the best idea to buy a 2007 holden Captiva 2nd hand. At the time it ticked all the boxes. We have a big family and not many options for a 7 seater vehicle. It previously had one owner who seemingly did everything right as far as servicing on time goes. So when we purchased our car 5 months ago we were thrilled. I had it serviced at the 10,000k mark as required by 5 year warranty @ highest possible coverage. A few weeks after that 1st service the needle rollers inside the rockers have Seized causing damage to the camshaft and hydraulic lifters. As per mechanics diagnosis.  Now the warranty company won't pay a cent as per warranty except to say they will give me $700 as an act of good will because it's only recently been purchased. The damage is 3,000. The dealer doesn't want a bar of it. Holden wants it in for diagnosis by them. None of this sounds good for me at the moment especially after reading up on this particular problem with the Captiva. At this stage I wish u could get around with a horse and carriage it might give me less trouble. I wonder if anyone has had a positive outcome with holden in regards to this issue? I've been told holden in Ashmore has had 20 Captiva's in there between Christmas and now with the same problem.
After only 2 years transmission gone, am without my craptiva since the end of January waiting for it to be repaired. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are having the same problem. There's even a facebook page for us disappointed frustrated Craptiva owners. Do not buy.
2008 Captiva LX. Excellent diesel economy up to 7.5 L/km average both town and country combined and 15km/L towing a caravan. No problems, drives and handles well. Will buy another.
Continuous problems, with fuses initially, DVD player not working within 6 months of  purchase of brand new vehicle. followed by change of body control module @ 50,000 kms, with another 20,000 KMS even bigger issue, timing chain replacement. within a month of it AC not working. issues galore, don't get excited by 7 seater value for money thing! Stay away
Just after the warranty was finished (that's another worry) the engine light on our 2006 CX craptiva starting showing then dissappearing. Twice the car actually just stopped while I was driving. Both times I had to have the car towed to the holden dealer in Ashmore. After paying approx. $700 for the first so called solution which the holden service people said they replaced the oil switch. the engine light went away for approx. 4 days before the engine light reappeared and the car just stopped. Again the car was towed back to Lion Holden Ashmore and when we went to pick up the car, Holden told us that they replaced the alternator switch and the amount to pay was $600!! I asked to see the faulty part but I was told that the part had been thrown away with the other parts so they would not be able to show me which one was the exact one. I asked to see the job sheet but mysteriously they could not locate it but they were happy to give me an itemised invoice and was told if I was happy with the job they would remove the part and I could have the car towed to another place for fixing. Where has the 'service' gone???? We have had the car checked by an independent assessor and have been told that the fault is the timing chain and that this is common for the Captivas especially 2006 models. Again why did Holden allow these faulty models to stay on the roads putting lives at risk and creating so many - what were Holden supporters to become Holden runnaways?? I have given up trying to find someone who is willing to listen and assist us to get our only form of transport back on the road. Our hard earnt $$ have been wasted away and will total up to $50k by the time we finish paying off the car. shame on you Holden :( :(
I recently traded in my Captiva and there are definitely some things that I miss! I know a lot of people hate these cars... But I didn't have too many bad experiences. Pros: It was enjoyable to drive, relatively fuel efficient for an SUV (got about 700km on average per tank) and had lots of storage space. I loved the electric drivers seat, cooled glove box, climate control and pollen filters - which my new car lacks. Plus, in the looks department,  Captiva's are very attractive. Cons: Whenever the headlight bulbs blew, which seemed to be a couple of times per year (and not fuse related), they were a pain in the neck to replace because of the big metal plate in the way. It also wasn't very quick off the mark - when accelerating from stationary there was a good second or so of lag before the vehicle would respond. This could be a little annoying at round abouts but really, I just had to adapt the way I drove to suit the vehicle. The price of tyres was also annoying... But that's all SUV's and not specific to Captiva's.
Bought my LTZ 3lt petrol last Nov2014. Expected to have a bit of power but was disappointed on lacking of power and high fuel consumptions. But until I was adviced not to use lower than 95% octane. Fuel consumption is better and more km per full tank. Interior is very spacious and ride is comfortable. Tested CRVs and Hyundai, comparisons were no way near Captiva.
Just decided to buy a captiva 7  ltz after driving a sante fe. The sante fe hylander is a good looking car  but at 62k I couldnt justify the money. Captiva is 39k with similar features and what seemed like a softer ride and smoother power delivery.
I purchased my Holden captiva LX petrol new 2009 and have never had a problem! It's been a fabulous family car, very luxurious, love all the features, great reverse camera, the kids love watching movies on the tv, it drives smoothly & tows my 14ft caravan with no issues.Love it!
Bought a brand new Captiva sx 7 seater petrol engine in April 2012.The car was awesome for the first 3 months.Then a rattling noise started coming from the engine,(have since found out it's a bearing.)you wouldn't expect that from a new car.Mechanics have never picked it up,Holden won't give us any answers.The shockers need to be replaced,4 new tyres.It is the worst car I have owned.
2010 lx captiva top of the line and more problems then room here lights on dash are random engine issues .
Purchased a captiva 7 in 2012, within two years transmission blew up, in the last 8 months I have had every major component in the car replaced.  The car lost power on the freeway due to the engine thinking there is a problem so it shut down.  I have had two close calls nearly having serious accidents because the car has no power when you accelarate.  so upset about this i dont recomend this car to anyone especially young families the captiva 7 is a dangerous car.
Gear box blew up 10000Km, heater element cracked, computer and GPS replaced, kept locking us out, oil leaks constant, has been nothing but trouble not game to drive it out of town.
I purchased my Beautiful black  Captiva  last October 2014 i Ve never been so happy ,I added a beautiful chrome bull bar and step sides ,it turns heads and I'm so proud driving my Captiva .thank you Ross Grey Holden
Today I went shopping for a new family car and to be honest I had my heart set on the Captiva 7 lx diesel. Well I thought it was a great idea to leave the cap till last. Firstly I tried the isuzu mux, wow but noisy and uncomfortable but that was to be expected as it is more of a workhorse. Then we tried the kia sportage, yeh not bad but didn't really feel it was for me. Next was the hyundai sant fe, very surprised by it effortless and beautiful to drive. Finally we get into the captiva (craptiva) what a friggen let down! I swear that I am grieving after having such high expectations of this monsterous piece of crap.. sure they look quite nice from the exterior but just get into the drivers seat to find out how disappointing this vehicle is. Extremely uncomfortable and a major lack of guts.i cannot believe that anyone would want to buy one of these. They are terrible and definitely not worth the money. I was sure that this was going to be the right vehicle for us but I can't say that I could recommend it to anyone. A serious let down!
I purchased a Captiva 7 LS MY15 on the 31/12/14 to maximise the deal that Holden was offering at the time. The MY14 were advertised at $29k Drive away but was out of stock. I managed to secure a MY15 with the colour of my choice and a number of extras including tow pack for 29K drive away with 5 years warranty. When comparing this with other vehicles at this price point, nothing came close. 30K was my budget and the size and features filled my list of requirements.I had spent many hours researching and read many negative reviews but also spoke to a number of friends that currently drive Captiva's with good reviews.In the end it my decision to purchase one came down to value for money. I realise that a Captiva is what it is. It is not a Toyota, ford, Nissan or Mitsubishi all of which have their positives and negatives. It is also important to note that people are more likely to leave a review if they are dissatisfied with a product or service.In my opinion, it is very comfortable to drive. Yes the suspension is firm but corners without too much body roll.fuel consumption is high compared to what is advertised and is sitting around 13/100km much better on open road and may get better when engine is run in.Yes, slightly underpowered for a 2.4 petrol pulling 1.8 ton but once up and going has reasonable acceleration. Build quality is average when you consider how flimsy the steel body panels are and over use of plastic trim on the outside. The seats are not the most comfortable seats around and the fabric and carpet is on the cheaper side.The space inside is good for the flexibility of a growing family. I run a business and the seats fold in different configurations to created a lot of storage space not to mention carrying up to 7 people. It advertises self levelling rear suspension so will be interesting to see if this works with 7 adults in the car.Not happy with Holden's 9 month service schedule. Not necessary in my opinion with the development of quality motor oils. This is Holden's way to pull back some of their losses of $245 capped services.So at the end of the day, you get what you pay for. If you are happy with a car that drives well, can seat up to 7 people but lacks refinement of a Japanese car then it should suit your requirements. Please note that I have only driven 1000KM and cannot comment on the reliability but post another review in 12 months time. For those who want to ask me more specific questions, you can contact me at iliodi@Hotmail.com. I hope this helps?
2007 Diesel Piece of s@×t! Absolutely horrid! Towed to be repaired,  only to be returned unrepaired! Ongoing issues that Holden refuse to repair! Engine breaks coming on randomly causing the car to slow down to a near stop.  New driver seat. New petrol tank cover (twice). Anti skid breaks coming on randomly. Radio changes frequency to CD or from FM to AM when the volume button is pushed. Turn the volume ip or down on the radio and the CD stsrts playing.  This has been investigated on numerous occasions,  only to be told there is nothing wrong with it,  and if I want it investigated any further I have to fund it myself. ..even though the problem was never resolved! Car steers to the left even though it has had plenty of wheel alignments. Blinkers turn off and on intermittenly. Makes for a fun day out being abused by other motirists, thinking that you're just an mean for not indicating!!! Rear wiper doesn't always work when switched on, but works when the engine is turned off....Go figure!  The car has even been on fire! BUT, do you think they would replce the car? Absolutely not! Even the dealership i bought it from know it's a dud, but refuse to acknowledge it! Obviously I think GMH are the biggest rip off. Quick to make themselves rich at our expense,  but very poor in their customer service :-(
A connector of the gear box came off while driving causing a close all with a cattle truck.  That was in the first two weeks following a cam shaft actuator a fault from manufacture in the oil area causing loss of oil pressure the problem took two weeks to diagnose and they had to replace the lot.  Cam shaft actuator repaired once replaced once all in the first 18 months.  I doubt the car will last long.  The resale value of the car is very poor as well.  I have been gravely dissapointed in the purchase and it has caused me huge anxiety.  Never again Holden
I have never had a more less reliable car ever.  Towing mechanisim melted to bottom of car, timing belt casing leaking, needed new tranmission, windscreen wipers come on when starting car, full engine rebuild at 85000kms.  The car is crap and so is holden customer car.
Drives well, comfy, fits everyone in with enough room to spare. I know a few people who love theirs & only one who hated theirs. I guess all those that love them are too busy out driving their cars to write a positive review! :) I would buy another one.
Constant issues with turbo dropping out from the day i drove it out of the car yard (6km on the clock). Water bottle hose keeps coming off from behind the head light, only way to get to it is to take the light out... Service light is constantly on even after a full service  Reports from other friends who have a captive my problems are nothing.  Holden you have dropped the ball and lost so many customers. compensation to all especially the ones who have had to do full engine rebuildsStart looking into your customer service before you loose all your customers!!
twice it would not start  not my car but family  HOLDEN you should be ashamed of yourselves selling the public a piece of junk made in Korea  and you do nothing to help people with problems with the Captiva's hold your head in shame  HOLDEN  SUCK
I purchased a petrol version Captiva LTZ in May 2014. Overall the car is really quite nice minus a few flaws. It is comfortable, nice to drive, great space however it takes a lot of petrol. I have tried driving it on straight country roads, around town and I ca an’t get it below 12L per 100km no matter what I do - believe me I have tried (the brochures stated 10L). There have also been a couple other small issues that included a rattle behind the steering wheel and the fact that my wipers died in the middle of a massive storm. These were fixed by the service department.  Do I like the car? yes, it’s ok. Would I buy another one - No.
I bought a 2008 60th anniversary Captiva, wow what a huge mistake that was! Not only did I get sweet stuff all out of a full tank of fuel, but had constant issues with engine light coming on, stability control lights coming on if I happened to drive over a small bump on the road, constant oil leaks even though mechanics would fix it, breaks failed on me a few times electrical issues to the point I had to change my battery every year as it would get completely drained, traction control issues, awd would just stop working, cost a fortune to service, and at 105,000 km major engine failure! Took it back to the dealer I bought it from and was in workshop for 3 weeks, in that time I bought a new car went back to a ford territory, got a phone call from the new owners of my old Craptiva to say they had all the dash warning lights come on a week after they bought it! Which was 2 weeks after I sold it back to the dealer, after it had had everything fixed! My advice to anyone and everyone STAY CLEAR OF CAPTIVAS unless you have lots of money and are happy to be constantly taking it in for repairs ... Oh and they go through Tyres worse than a teenage boy doing burnouts on weekends!
Unless you have no self respect, unlimited funds, a spare car to use when your CAPTIVA is being repaired ( every other day) don't touch Holden. Their customer service is equal to their product.  Rubbish.
throttle body gone cost 800. Yet to diagnose why oil is in diesel. In danger of diesel run on as oil levels dangerously high. Finding parts from wreckers then flogging off.
I loved my 2007 Diesel Captiva even though it had a few odd " quirks". Until today when the motor blew up (almost literally in a massive cloud of smoke!), while on a dirt road in the country. Now I am reading all of these reviews and realize I have just kissed my money goodbye - not worth repairing. We onlyhave the one car atm and in a rural community we are already struggling to get to work as it is! Now this. So upset. No wheels, no work. Snowballs from here. What a pain.
Have got a 2012 Holden Series II Captiva 7 3lt, the fuel was high first but got better around 20,000, 30,000 km.
My drive belt was replaced at 36000k 12 months & 23000k later same noisey problem. My dealer is now going to replace belt, pully & tensioner under tech. advice from GMH under warranty, I am concerned what happens in the next 30000k.November 24th 2016 Update: Captiva auto gear box105,000k gearbox Stuck in 1st. After a violent jerk and not changing gears. Dealer fitted recon box that failed after 55k. Spent a week trying to fix it with various parts Now Holden agree to fit a brand new transmission under our extended warranty. Serviced by same dealer since new.
I bought this car 2 years ago and have been very happy. Love all the points for charging  electrical items. Seats move up and down easily for the 2 back seats. Tonnes of room to fit suit cases in the back to or from airport and to take rubbish to the tip. (as 5 seater only)  Front passenger seat also collapses down so that you have the whole length for long items. Eg wood. It is lovely to drive, easy to park and has been great for my back pain - the seats and height to get in and out are good for me. I have has not servicing issues. Dealership was easy to deal with and respectful to me as woman with little car knowledge. Update December 2014. My car has just had its 90,000 service and still goes like a dream. Got new tyres which i am told  is not bad to get 90,000 out of tyres. The other thing is I still think the seats are good for my back. I like that the rear window opens separately to the door, handy if the boot is full or you don't want to open it.
Ive had our brand new ltz 7 for 2 months now and i love it. Its only done 1300ks but hasnt missed a beat. Fuel is sitting a little high 13.2/100ks but hopefully with a bit more long distance driving over Christmas it will drop down a bit more. Revs high but whatever. Its a great family car for us. I love it. Like others i will report back once weve had it for a year :)
We purchased a brand new Captiva 7 12 months ago.  The car is hard on fuel even driving at 98km ph it used around 12lt+ per 100km and noisy going through gear changes among other things. We traded it on a more economical car just prior to the rego being due and had done only 7500km. I would not recommend this car to anyone
We purchased a Dec built 2013 LX captiva 7  2.2 Diesel  auto in May of this year. Must admit I had my doubts when I purchased it as I had read the negative comments after I had done the deal. Silly me, but I have had no problems with this vehicle what so ever. I have towed a large heavily laden trailer and she pulled well and the fuel economy was quite competitive with other diesel vehicles. My only concern is that I have been informed that Holden only use environmentally friendly oils in these vehicles which causes the engine to crash around the 100 to 120 thousand mark to which Holden has not answered my question to this. Apparently this is common knowledge to most mechanics in the trade, Colorados and the Ford Ranger are in this mix also although the Ford dealers use a more suitable oil and the problem is less evident but is still there. What do others know about this.
I have had nothing but issues with my car since I purchased it brand new in 2010.I have had power issues - it just cuts out. Can't steer, can't break..... cant do anything. You just keep going till you finally stop. Extremely scary when in traffic. It's dangerous for me, it's dangerous for others on the road. Went in quite a few time because of that. Fast forward till now, its currently out of warranty,and now I am currently getting engine warning lights, been told its oxygen sensors, replace those - just under $2000 to do both, it comes back on. Told it needs a software update. I do that. It comes back on. Told its the catalytic converter? Ha! Mind you I'm also told there is a page full of codes and it could be anyone of those but they say cataytic converter. Yeah another $2000 I have also been told its the fuel I use, the oil in the car and god knows how many other things it could be. Never get a straight answer. Holden head office were no help at all.
Bought a brand new 2014 Captiva LS in Aug 2014 or so I thought. It turned out to be a 2013 model but holden staff and management say bad luck for you it sat on the dock for so long. They couldn't care less.  Have had nothing but trouble. Yes it's bad on fuel, I've had to take time off work taking this thing back to service department twice now. Firstly the clock and radio wouldn't work. Then on a hot day at the beach with young children it wouldn't start. Came back to the car it was unlocked, and wouldn't start. Dead. Waited an hour for RAA. Flat battery. He said this is a common occurrence with new cars, the electronics mysteriously stuff up and cause the battery to die in very short periods. I rang the service department and they claim of course they have never heard of it. What a lot of rubbish. So much for getting a new supposedly reliable car. I want to get rid of it as well. How do I go about this.
Wow its endless problems with these... had a recall for oil leak, then another oil leak, then engine light and now starter motor! the car is 1y6 months old and has been in for repairs 4 times. dont buy of SUNCO HOLDEN Maroochydore as they dont give you a hire care unless you want to wait 4 weeks !!!
I am stuck with this car as it's company owned. I love cars and will tell you the cons as there is no pros.This is what we have observed in the 2 years we have had it as it was brand new.1.  It's very noisy (diesel model)2.  You need to use your phone in your hand to dial numbers etc as there is no screen on the stereo3. Air conditioner? It's either too cold or too hot. You turn the dial 1 notch and it changes 5 degrees4. The engine light is on now and there is no power5. The plastic moulds around the wheel arches have faded6. The seatbelt is showing signs of wear. 7. The reverse sensors are not beeping anymore8. There are noises in the cabin from the steering rack The above points are 100% accurate. Why by a Craptiva? They are made by Daewoo. It's not a Holden. I guarantee you that.Please stay away and don't get excited cause it's 7 seater and it's convenient. Buy something else that is 7 seater.
Had our Captiva just over a year 80000ks and now transmission is stuffed. Only a month out of warranty they replaced computer thinking that was the problem but have now realised its the planetary set in transmission. Holden do not make this part only full transmission replacement for up to ten grand. They stung me 4.5 grand for initial problem now this! Anyone else had this issue?
Worst SUV ever, underpowered, electrics unreliable, recalls, the list goes on and on, not many positives to mention because its a lemon.
Bought 2014 7ltz. Before that i did test drive 2014 Toyota Kluger (74k) and Hyandai ix35. But Captiva came out to be best value for money under 40k for a top of the range vehicle. So far drive is so smooth and like every bits of it. I like interior and exterior of this car than ix35. i am going to write another in one year time .
My 2011 Capitva 5  Series II was initially off the road within 2 weeks with oil leak that produced clouds of smoke, then a week later the engine management light was on continuously, back in again, then the Eco button for the auto transmission was faulty for a year. Excellent attention from GMH and dealer BUT had very old loan cars then hire car. Then 2 years in we had the oil leak spoken about in this forum, off the road 3 & 4 days twice engine and transmission had to be taken out and seal reapplied, now booked in again same issue and now the starter motor has seized today. Tow to dealer , off the road all weekend plus who knows how long next week, no second car makes it very difficult.Car is great when working  BUT now 3 + years old and non stop issues.
I bought a Captiva 7 LTZ from the Mudgee NSW dealership and the car is fantastic! You get lemons with every car manufacturer, but this car is awesome and the dealership had been very helpful with any issues I've had (minor)Air vents to the middle and rear would be nice but I knew that before I put any money down to buy it.Don't just look at the outside, get in it and check if what the car has is rite for you. 1st diesel car...won't be the last one either
I have 2010 Captiva LX and in 3 years the screen has blanked a few times. It can remain blank for months. Holden said they would replace it on warranty , or fix it, but neither happened. On a hunch (I work in IT), I worked out you can reset this yourself. Here's how - 1) make sure your ignition is off. 2) Now press the first 3 physical buttons on Nav unit and keep holding them down for another 10 seconds, while you start the car. Your screen will come back to life. Why the first 3 buttons? Well, I decided to hold as many buttons as I could wile re-powering the unit. It's probably just the menu button I suspect.
We purchased a  diesel Captiva 7LTZ and have done over 7000 klms in 6 weeks , car travels well , bit heavier on diesel than I thought it would be  8.7 LP100K and I would like higher profile tyres for country driving. Seats [leather] more comfortable than they look and after 10 hour drive I still felt ok .   After driving a Statesman for 12 years I am surprised at the comfort and very  best thing is my wife likes the smaller car.  Warranty , free sevice , been able to fit excellent bullbar auto/diesel and 7 seats makes it all good , I almost forgot my wife got the cupholders she wanted  . James at Kensels ,Tamworth has been very helpful ,Thankyou.Update June 2016, 47000 from tyres , still uses more fuel than it should for smaller car.Does have issues with electronics which they do not seem to be able to fix.Beeps at rather funny times .Still OK to drive , have doubts as to buying another one .Resale value not good , purchase and keep  for long term best I think typical run into groung give to one of the grandkids..
Made the mistake of buying a CAptiva 7 LS. I know I should have bought a higher model but I didn't realise just how bad the 2.4l petrol engine would be along with a gearbox that can't maker up its mind what gear to be in. Fuel consumption has been atrocious. It's got a 65ltr tank but the range around town is 550kms before I need to refill. Open road milage is just as bad as the car is seriously underpowered. I've also found that traction from the front wheels (2WD)is poor especially in the wet. Can't wait to get rid of this thing....
5 out of 5, reviewed on Oct 08, 2014 originally posted in Captiva 5 seriesI have had my Captiva 7 diesel since January and so far I have only 2 minor but irritating complaints. The blue tooth connectivity is so limited. There is only a last number dialed call feature so each time I wish to call a different number I have to pull over and call from the phone. Accept it is probably safer to do so but I don't think this lack of full connectivity is well understood in the sales s ections locally and interstate from the answers I have received. However it is a minor issue only. My real concern is the navigation system. I have had it replaced 3 or 4 times and the problem is not resolved. I have it booked for service later this month and hopefully this time I will see a resolution. Reason for writing is find if others have a similar problem as I am told this has not been raised before. Problem - having entered a destination that I know takes about 3 hours to arrive the system tells me 6 and half hours to arrival. It is always the same for this particular destination (in each of the replacements) so it is not just a one off error. Other destinations that I am unsure of the time to arrival if they are outside a metropolitan area I have the same issue. Travel interstate was a real problem as I needed to know the time of my arrival for a booking and could not rely on the system to give me a reasonable arrival time. It was in fact many hours out. It does count down as one gets closer to the destination but that isn't always helpful or safe if travelling alone in country areas. I often borrow a portable Garmin system to take with me for accuracy. I just wish to have my navigation working as it should - accurately. I wonder if others have a similar problem because the system is not fully fit for purpose and after so many replacements (one of which was the wrong type) surely it could be upgraded so it is accurate. Other than those two issues (the phone being minor) I am really happy with my Captiva. I just want the navigation system working properly.
I purchased a brand new 2012 Holden Captiva series II in September 2012 thinking it was a smart move to buy a new car rather than a second hand car. never ever have I been so wrong. The car started out fine until a few months in my air con suddenly stopped working, took it into Holden where they advised me the air-con needed regasing after only a few months!! Holden seemed not to think this was a big problem, they regassed the air con and I haven't had any problems with that since. What I have had troubles with is my car overheating, the first time was in Feb this year, I called my local dealership who advised me I had to organise a tow or I wouldn't be covered under my warranty. I was told I had to cover the costs for the tow and have since found out that in fact Holden should have covered the cost under my warranty. Holden kept the car for 3 days then called me to advise the car had somehow dropped all it's coolant but after their testing they couldn't find any leaks. They told me they frankly had no idea what had happened for me to loose all my coolant but that they had topped it up and all costs are covered under the warranty oh and also and I should keep an eye on my coolant. I asked what would happen if I had the same problem again because I can't be driving around in a faulty car, the man told me 'I am not a mind reader how could I tell you what will happen' I responded by telling him I wasn't looking for him to tell me the future I was asking for Holden's procedure in the event a car has the same problem multiple times. He responded with I don't know and quickly moved me along. Actually the whole 5 mins the guy spoke to me for all he rally said was 'I don't know'. He couldn't care less about my car they're probably just waiting for my warranty to run out. Fast forward to July, once again my car overheats. No problems found (this was through a different mechanic) but I have no coolant. Coolant gets topped up and I'm sent on my way. Today my car overheated again and I couldn't even get Holden to answer their phone for me to organise for the car to be looked at AGAIN. I will be getting it towed in tomorrow and hopefully I get a better answer than 'I don't know' also the car had a warranty recall for the fuel pipe in amongst all the other dramas and I had to replace tyre after only 20000km. Worst decision ever.
2008 Holden Captiva 105,000 km bearings in Roller rocker fail.This is a common fault, Holden changed bearings being used in late 2009 models.Why didn't they recall and change the earlier models, has anyone approached ACCC or LAC on this matter
I have a Captiva Diesel 2007 with 135,000km on the clock.  Always oil changed on schedule with really expensive oil to protect the engine.  Driving along the Eastern freeway when suddenly bang- bang- bang! from the engine and total loss of power.  The roller rockers have failed….$4,000+ to repair.  If only I had known - a bit of Internet research shows that this appears to be a super-common problem with the diesel Captiva.Why wouldn't Holden do a recall?  Or at least do the right thing and advise owners of the potential time-bomb under the hood so we could take preventative action.  Holden Social Media Team - I know you guys monitor and selectively respond to posters on this forum.  Can you provide an explanation of why Holden has not addressed this issue?
Well it's been two years since purchase and I'm still very happy with my purchase.  It continues to run well, delivers fuel economy and people continue to tell me how smart it looks, how smoothly it runs and ask if I'm happy with it.  Of course my answer is  YES!
Just bought a 2014 captiva 7 LTZ Diesel . Only have 170 klms on it so far, but I'm happy with 98% of the experience thus far. After reading all the negatives on the various forums after buying !!  However I'm impressed. I've been lucky enough to have owned many diesel vehicles and can judge reasonably well I think how it compares to others I've owned.  I enjoy driving it. It gives me a sence of occassion. The power and transmission are nicely matched. Fuel consumption around town so far has been glacial. But of course really too early to judge properly. I'll write again in 3 months.
OK I have been game and bought the current model - 3 days in and have taken it back for a noise in front end when braking (said it was the brushes) and will order them in.This is my third - cannot really fault them - all have been the petrol model have always disposed of them before too many klm on the clockthe only major breakdown - fuel pump & a blown computer chipmy recommendation would be - never let them run out of warranty - make sure your services are on time - so they don't shaft you on a warranty issue.my last Captiva - only replaced 2 tyres in over 75K of drivingwhereas the 2007 model was a dog for tyreshighway driving 8-9town driving 11-12
I have had my 2013 Captiva 7 LX with the V6 engine for almost 12 months. It has loads of power and an extremely comfortable ride. It has done 20,000 km and hasn't missed a beat. It handles extremely well both on the highway and off-road. The changeover between 2WD and 4WD happens without any perception of change.The cabin noise is very low and so far it hasn't developed any annoying rattles. The sound system is very good and the connectivity is excellent, with both the Bluetooth and usb connections being instantly recognized and available.Towing a fully laden trailer is effortless, although I found reversing the trailer is a little tricky as the high back obscures the view and the rear camera is automatically switched off when the trailer plug is inserted.It has lots of features built in, such as electronic stability control and downhill assist to name but two.There is loads of space available inside especially when all of the seats, apart from the driver seat, can fold down flat. The electric driver seat is fantastic.I was very impressed when it came with a 5 year warranty and 5 year roadside assist too.
We have just down graded from a holden ve twin turbo ss. Yes my hubby was sceptical & nearly cried. We have only had our 2011 captiva 5 series Ii , 6 speed manual for a week but we love it. Considering hubby drives B-Doubles for a living he's over the moon.I drive it too work everyday. Mileage is good, stero is awesome. We have a very large dog who when we lay the seats down can put his head out the windows. First night he actually refused to get out of it & slept in the back all night.
Since the first week of buying this car we have had problems. After 12 months of going backwards and forwards they discovered an issue with the diesel particle filter. We've also had to replace the battery and currently it looks like the starter motor has gone. Thankfully it's all been under warranty (apart from the battery) but we are a one car family who have to use the car for travel. I did my homework before buying this car (as best I could as it was the new model).
We purchased a brand new Holden Captiva 7 2014 SX. In March this year, it is only 3 months old. So far we have had two engine cutouts on a 110 km highway loosing all power, steering and breaks. Holden roadside assistant told us we had to arrange our own tow after hours and they could not help us. Thank god we had RAC. Now the vehicle is in the dealership, after the air conditioner, began bellowing smoke from the engine bay. The service department, assured us that is not a warranty fix, as before they even looked at it, told us that it is common with the captivas to get stone damage into the condenser. They have not even looked at it, my god. They car by the way has never been off road. Apparent Captiva problem. And I price of $1500 to fix. The captiva is a lemon, noise rattling startups, terrible fuel consumption, no power, cannot over take on a highway without it sounding like it will explode. Please don't by one. It is our first Holden, as we have owned Toyota's and Fords in the past. Holden have been terrible with customer service, road side assistance, and now guaranteeing us it is a none warrantable repair, before even assessing it. As they get this problem all the time with the Captiva's. Just don't by one, please, buy a ford or Toyota instead.
We couldn't understand why we couldn't get it to work but after reading previous review realise that it is not us! We are not happy that it doesn't have a true spare wheel. We expected better mileage when driving on economy. Mileage not too bad on long trips though. Really like the way spare seats compact.
I am the origional poster about the Captiva losing power!. After numerous trips back to the holden dealership to be told nothing was wrong every time,  we sold our Captiva not even a year after buying it brand new!. Worst car we have ever owned!!. Death trap waiting to happen!!!!!. Be Warned.......
I have a 2011 series 2 captiva 5 which I purchased brand new and have had problems with it jumping out of gear ever since I got it, has anyone else had this happen?I have told holden about it and they have reset the gearbox computer but it still does it and they dont no why.I hope it doesnt turn into something serious.
I have a 2007 Holden Captiva Maxx. I purchased this car believing the standards of Holden production and design were reliable for our future family we were planning..and I couldn't have been more WRONG!! I am now stuck out of pocket with a lemon of a car and the issues are inherent to Holden. The catalytic converters break down and feed through the engine eventually killing the engine.. the transmission is failing and the lag in acceleration is dangerous not to mention the earth shattering clunk that shakes the whole car as it finally finds a gear. Design wise the lack of reverse camera is notable as it has a massive blind spot.. ill never own another Holden and I don't believe in the integrity of the brand anymore. If you own one and you are reading this if the niggles have started jump ship now while you can. If you were thinking of buying one read the reviews and DON'T.
Having purchased A New 2012 Holden Series II Captiva 5 In August 2012, I Looked Forward To The Benefits Of A New vehicle,  Ohh How Wrong Was I. By October 2013, The vehicle stalled suddenly On 4 Occasions While Driving  And Would Not Start Again For 10-15 Minutes. After A Week In The Workshop, The Cam Shaft Sensor Was Replaced However No Faults Were Registered On The Computer System. April 2014, Same Fault occurred And Vehicle  Remains In The Workshop. 3 Weeks On And No Diagnosis.Update:Following my post in April 2014, I'm disappointed to report that my Holden Captiva 5 Series II 2012, has done it again and remains a lemon. The vehicle stalled again on two occasions and wouldn't start. Returned to the dealership to be only told again, 'no fault' can be identified. After seeking advice from technical support, the computer system and wiring has been replaced. Third time lucky?? I'm very sceptical. Lost all faith in this vehicle and have got nothing positive to say about my experience with Holden Customer Care. They don't care, they want the case closed and you off their books. They don't worry about consumers safety or fellow road users safety. Furthermore Holden Customer Care won't provide you with any documentation in relation to the matter, unless you insist, which I'm still waiting to receive.
We purchased a Series II Captiva 5 Diesel in 2012, it's been a fabulous car for the most part. That is, once the whole HVAC system was replaced within the first four months, the plastics on the dash replaced, the plastics on the outside replaced too. The first year it spent a little over three weeks in the shop being fixed. Mechanically, it hasn't missed a beat, great mileage averaging 8.5-9.0L/100km city driving. But roll on its second birthday and we have yet again, had the plastics outside replaced due to fading. All manner of rattles, squeaks and groans have set in, more than we have ever had in any other car we have owned. And don't get us started on tyres ... 25,000kms in and we need a new set.  Then there's that little issue with the diesel DPF - we have full understanding of diesels and urban driving, but all manufacturers need to make buyers aware of the DPF in baby diesels especially. After losing confidence in the plastics on the body of the car, the issues with the DPF, tyres, expensive servicing, we decided we would cut our loses, offload and now drive a Toyota. If you are buying a Captiva, read the reviews here and buyer beware ... You will experience one or more of the issues you come across on this forum. Holden will tell you their latest and greatest fix *cough* cover up ... They aren't in the business of fixing the issues, just hiding them. If they were, they would have sorted them out before the series II was released. Yet here we are, the Captivas have been out since 2008 or so and the ongoing issues prevail.
Where do I start? This car has given me nothing but grief as I've had it in and out of the dealership with warning lights illuminating, these included problems with the diesel particulate filter and the electronic stability control,  plus I've had a heap of other problems like the stereo cutting out and the transmission shuddering. I've seriously had a gutful of this lemon Captiva and dealing with holden dealerships. Stay away from holden.
I got this fully spec'd with sunroof, racks, 18" alloys etc, etc. It replaced a 2010 Diesel LX. The Diesel LX had a dreadful accelerator lag but did move along quite well. I expected the petrol V6 to be a little more exciting. It is marginally better but it's such a heavy car it can't sprint and if you're putting the boot in the petrol consumption flies. We're getting about 15lt/100 around town and a better 8-9lt/100 on country/highway drives.It's a very nice car to drive, it's versatile storage handling, abundant power outlets, great sound system.However, the sound system, navigation, climate control and trip info are all accessed via the same computer. It was recalled for an update. The update fried the computer and rteplacement took 2 weeks. The replacement unit freezes regularly, the reversing camera sometimes takes minutes to activate.The electronic park brake lets the vehicle move 5 to 10 centimeters after its applied and your foot is released from the brake pedal.
I am driving Captiva 7 LX 2012 Model. Having problem with Air-Conditioning at the back row. there is no Air-Vents at back row, so people for who r sitting on 2nd and 3rd row they dont get enough aircon.. so how do i fix this problem. I already spoke to Holden people and they cant help me with this....
Please keep in mind this car is not yet even 3 weeks old. On Tuesday 11th February I tried to start the vehicle and it wouldn’t start. I believed it had a flat battery.Wednesday afternoon the engine light kept coming on and going off. I thought it was strange for that to happen. Also that the handbrake was disengaging and had to keep applying it before the car was able to start. I kept applying the handbrake before turning the car off and then exiting the vehicle and getting back in and starting again only to find it wouldn’t start with the handbrake disengaged. Thursday night 13th February  I started the vehicle there was a lot of ‘popping noises’  and even my wife ran outside to ask what the noise was. The car was idling very strange, making a sound like a battery operated device dying. All of the engine and other lights were flashing on the dashboard and the car was making beeping noises. There was something leaking out of the exhaust pipe that looked and smelt like fuel.  Friday 14th February approximately 7am I decided to attempt to drive the vehicle while recording, there was a major failure with the vehicle. I hadn’t even driven the car approximately 200 metres before it had complete loss of power at a major roundabout.  I had to jump out of the vehicle and stop approaching cars and direct them to go around the car, fearing it would be hit. I got back into the car and managed to start it, it was making a grinding noise and I moved two metres before it lost power again. I turned off my camera at this point and jumped out of the car again to direct cars. I asked a passing jogger to help me direct cars to go past me while I was able to start and move the car straight to the side of the road.
I bought a 'top of the range' Captiva in 2012 - Brand new model. Very disappointing!!The car just seems to rattle, noises coming from every angle, nowhere near a smooth drive, lacks power, CHEAP quality interior, mainly cheap plastic. Low quality leather, very poorly designed display screen, terrible sound system (not premium as advertised) interior scratches too easily, electrics seem to be playing up, especially the mp3 player! It refuses to play mp3, even regular discs are rejected. Display screen has been reset 3 times due to a fault, which means the reverse camera won't work, or the audio! Not enough aircon vents for a 7 seater, small boot once all 7 seats are in use. I've recently sold the Captiva, never again! Also bad on fuel.
several major issues with mineengine leak- engine pulled out and fixedair-condition totally broke, brand new compressor and wiringstarter motor stuffedwiring issues to battery broke down 4 times before they found issue.DON'T BUY THIS CAR WILL END UP ON BACK OF TOW TRUCK MORE THAN ON THE ROAD.
Bought a 2011 LX diesel, and after owning for 8mths we are selling and buying the Mazda CX9. Within the little time we have owned it the following has had to be replaced or repaired--- 4 oil leaksStarter motor cable and something in the started motor its self (still making funny noise at times when started)Turbo leaking fluid- replaced hoses Electric adjustment for driver's seat- would slide about (and took 2weeks to get part in)Injectors and seals leaving us with diesel in the engine and using heaps of extra fuel.Also- DVD unit in head rests- take ages to load up (like 5min) and are very difficult to work.Weird fuel usage- the trip down may take half a tank, but back will take nearly full tank (flat ground, same driver, same route, same stops-road work ect)Seats and suspension are HARD (Our 2000 patrol with full lift kit is softer) so you will end up with sore but cheeks and back. Cheap materials. Easy to crack-scratch plastics, head lights spider cracking, indicator covers cracked and have to buy whole mirror for nearly $400 just for little plastic cover.A great family care with tons of extras- very will thought out for family's and day to day usage. Honestly very sad to sell the car but we simply would not be able to afford to continue to fix it once the warranty runs out.
Purchased my captiva series 2 in feb 2012. From day one I knew there was an issue with the transmission. 2 yrs down the track they finally replaced the transmission now car actually drives like a normal car. 2 days later had to go back in to get drive shafts replaced. Passenger door handle snapped replaced. Clock not keeping time replaced. Eco button stuck replaced. Centre glove box lid lock spring snapped whole lid replaced. I'm very disappointed with the car. However my dealer has always done the right thing by me IN getting the car fixed even though it took 2 years to convince them there was an issue with the transmission. I'm dreading what's going to happen with only a year warranty left. Fuel consumption seen more on the heavier side. 9.1l as claimed was a marketing ploy that's for sure. Having issues with radio and aftermarket car kit. It's going back to the dealer.
We have a 2013 diesel SX model that has done 6000km and we have had nothing but trouble! The DPF light keeps coming on, the noisy fan comes on regularly when we turn the car off and it shudders or has power surges at low RPMs. Our dealer tells us these are all "characteristics " of the Captiva???? The fuel economy is about 12l/100km!We just want to get rid of it!!!
Our diesel lx has 6000 kms and has served us well.there is a small rattle in the sunroof cover which has to be sorted under warranty.we leased our vehicle and compared it against many others on the market at the time and found its residual value was better than the equivalent.
We needed a family car that could fit our 4 kids (most are over 6 ft). We looked at all new 7+ seater cars. Excluding the huge 4w drives which are a nightmare to park in suburbia. Only the Captiva & the Kia Carnival let a 6 ft high person sit in the back without hitting their head on the ceiling. The Kia didn’t have a lap sash for the middle seat, so that left the Holden. With all the negative comments about it on this page re its previous models I was a bit nervous buying it.  After 6 months & a few long trips. My conclusions are :-1.	The seats are firm, but not uncomfortable. We were all fine after a 6 hr drive. 2.	The electronics & related gadgets all work well. (ie: Air cond, music, sun roof, etc) Reversing camera is essential.3.	The Sat Nav is debatable. OK in the country. In the city it will get you there but rarely will it pick the route I’d choose.4.	It handles well.  (for a big car). It doesn’t corner like a Porsche, or even a Nissan SSS. But you do get ABS, Traction control & a load of other features that do compensate for its size. 5.	So far we’ve had no dramas with anything mechanical, it all works well. 6.	11.1 ltrs/100 km. Not bad for a car of this weight. Get the Diesel. 7.	There is not a heap of leg room for the tall folks in the back row. But at least they fit. In short, this car cost $20k less than I’ve paid for a similar size from its competitors. And was a better fit for my needs. My tip. If buying new. Don’t get paint or leather protection etc. What they charge $2-3K for you can get done independently for $500 - $800K. And they seem to do a better job.
I have recently purchased the 3litre petrol lx model. I have had jackaroos, pajeros and more recently a jeep wrangler. This car, so far, exceeds them all especially at this price point. Very comfortable, handled brilliantly on a recent 350km winding country road drive, and has a luxury car feel about town. Have not experienced any of the issues of other reviewers, but then again have only had for 3 weeks and haven't fully tested everything. Although the vehicle lacks some features, eg contacts cannot be loaded to Bluetooth set up, overall it is a well equipped vehicle, again, particularly at this price.
Our car is four years old and we were so excited to be getting a new car but have been bitterly disappointed. After being at the dealership more times than I can remember including after break down a long way from home when the car was only a couple of months old and having to deal with Holdens continual arrogance and claims we are the only ones with such problems - we have had enough. The timing chain is gone again and of course as it no longer under warranty will cost us $4300 to fix. The airbag light comes on and we have been told it is due to the seats being adjusted - how ridiculous. The fuel efficiency is terrible - only 350km max to a 60l tank of fuel. It loses power frequently which is really scary when crossing a freeway. And the list goes on. We are now trading it in and because there is a warning light on on the dash we are being heavily penalised in terms of realisation value. Interestingly when this light came on under warranty they simply reset the computer most of the time. We will not only never buy another Captiva aka CRAPTIVA - we will never buy another Holden. The service department has been rude & arrogant & patronising. And they don't know it yet but I have lodged an application at VCAT where a representative of the dealership will be required to attend. The vehicle was misrepresented at the time of purchase in many regards and we are also seeking compensation for loss of trade-in value due to faults that existed prior to the warranty expiring but were  never fixed properly.
Knowing how difficult it is to choose a car to buy and how hard it is to find reliable advice I had to give my two cents worth on the 2013 Captiva 7 2.4lt petrol we just bought.First up when I was researching this car I couldn't really find much on the 2.4lt 4 cylinder petrol engine and specifically on its fuel economy. The low down is that this is a big car and the 4 cylinder is average on fuel. Ourts is 3 months old and we get 12-13 lts per 100km around town (in the car thats about 420KMs to a tank (60lts)). On the highway though its 9-10 lts per 100km (600kms to the tank). I think thats pretty close to the quoted figures by Holden.Second the performance is similarly average. The 6 speed auto needs to be booted to make it go.But its a family 7 seat SUV so I accept that. I'll get my performance when I buy my mid life crisis sports car.Thirdly the interior cabin equipment is pretty poor for a modern vehicle. The audio and environment controls (while they work fine and sound good) are dated and basic and you expect more in a 2013 model.But all that said for $28,650 drive away including a sun roof, side steps, premium paint, tow bar and rubber matts we're happy with the car. Its value that's hard to go past. Would I have preferred a Territory or Santa Fe etc? Yes I would but the budget was $30K not $40K...On the subject of the diesel, I believe they're $3,000 extra and in hind sight, even though the higher cost of diesel and the servicing costs make the extra cost money not really worth it in the medium term, I probably would have found the extra dollars and gone the diesel.Hope this helps you.
I really have very bad experiance with this car i bought from ballan holde, there is problem with with GPS and screen , it takes sometime 40 minutes to update. i will not recomment this car to anyone , i raised this issue to dealer and Holden itself , Holden said they cannot do anything and dealer says it is Holden' s problem not them. , do not recommend at all
I purchased a brand new Holden captiva cx Diesel engine September 2012, within the first 3 months the car was leaking oil. It is now with the dealership for the fourth time fixing another oil leak.  Each time the dealership have had to remove the engine to get to the leaks and has taken a min of three working days.  Not impressed.
New Captiva 7SX diesel purchased Feb 2013 less than 7000km runs very rough/shudder like miss fire as if running on 3 cylinders at 1500 RPM driving or sitting still. Over 3 months out of 9 in dealership still the same. Holden customer care now says it is a common characteristic of these vehicles and that's how they run, even though others don't do it and it runs horribly. Their advice is to increase acceleration to resolve the issue doesn't help when slow manouvres are required. Must say local dealerships have been good. Just want it resolved but apparently I just have to accept it because Melbourne says so!
I bought a 2011 Manual Captiva second hand with 23000km on the clock. It has been great so far. I drive to Roma Qld and back to Brisbane (1000km round trip) on a regular bases and I have piled on 7000km within 1.5months. It is quiet on the highway and it is a smooth ride. There are no rattles that other people have described. I would buy this car again without hesitation. I use about 9.3L per 100km on the hwy. It sits on 110km/hr at 2100/2200rpm.
At 63 km needs a new auto trans the horrer story grow s Keep Clear because when its out of warranty you wont want to get caught with this lemon as these are trow away trans so you could be up for thousands , transmisssion mechanics say they are getting heaps of them that have blown apart the same way .
Fun to drive, lovely appearance, have had many comments on how it is a nice vehicle.Pretty good on fuel. Has been very reliable. Plenty of cargo room.Love the electric seat control and many compartments for storage.Have made use of the seven seats on many occasions doing the soccer run.Kids are comfortable in the back seat a bit more room than some SUV's.
So excited to buy my new car, captiva 7 series 2 (sx). Picked it up less than a week ago - and omg! I don't think I can afford to run it. It came with 27kms and a full tank of gas - thought we would go away for the weekend....its now on 1020kms, I have refilled it twice and still on empty??? That's three tanks of gas and I drive like I'm driving miss daisy!!! My engine rattles like a tin can when its started and it smells like something's on fire under the engine. Its so horrible u can't run the a/c while driving or u will choke. And its meant to be rust proof. Um, no - just ask my exhausts!! Lets just say Moorooka dealership is going to have the headache of their lives dealing with me. I will not go away until I get my thirty thousand dollars worth. And I gave up my Kompressor for this!!!!! I wouldnt recommend this car to a damn terrorist!!!!!!
We bought an LX Series II Captiva with all the bells and whistles. The only thing we opted out of was a sunroof as I am not a fan of them.The first big problem we had was the car losing acceleration at random moments, mostly on the highway. We would be driving at 110k/ph and the would lose acceleration rapidly, no amount of pushing the accelerator would make it maintain speed, it would drop very rapidly. It would everntually kick back in after 40-60 seconds. Which was extremely dangerous and put us in some very scary situations.We took it to Holden where they kept the car for almost 4 days, upon pick up they told us they couldn't find a problem. We asked if they had driven it and they said yes and nothing had happened. We got to Holden and asked the mechanic to come for a drive. Within 4 minutes the car lost acceleration and the mechanics response was "ohh that's strange". We drove it back to Holden where they kept it for a week and picked it up being assured it was fixed. The next day the car did the same thing!!! The problem was not fixed at all and because we are almost an hours drive from the dealer we demanded they collect the car which they did. Another week in the workshop and it was eventually fixed.A few months later when we took it in for a service we mentioned there was an issue with the radio/GPS/Dash Computer programming. Whenever we would turn anything in the dash computer on/off or would turn the GPS on it would turn the radio off. Even simple things like checking fuel consumption, climate control etc, any touch would turn the radio off. Not a huge deal but very annoying. After the service they booked it in the following week and told us they would need it the entire week. The car was returned to us and they had replaced the entire computer system. On the way home I turned on a screen to check the climate control ...... and the radio switched off.We live in a semi rural area and have been going through brake pads every service with the discs also needing machining. Since taking it to a non-dealer mechanic we have found the pads have lasted much longer this time around.Another big issue has been tyres. The LX Series II has an odd sized tyre and up until recently there has been one brand of tyre available - Hancook. At $298 a tyre it is very expensive for a family car. Now Pirelli make this size, however they are even more expensive at $320 a tyre.The latest problem with the car happened last week. The car overheated on the freeway. There were no warning lights or sounds that the water level was low, the only warning is loss of speed and a sound when the car is already in the red.When we opened the bonnet there was a distinct smell of burning plastic. We waited for it to cool down and opened the water cap only to have black sludge spew out of it. Upon inspection we realised this was oil and not melted plastic.I called Holden and was told to call my roadside assistance (we don't have one) which I thought was a very fruitless exercise as I was positive a roadside mechanic could not fix oil in the water tank. So I asked Holden to call me a tow truck which they were not too impressed with. The tow truck came and funnily enough he told me they pick up so many Captivas it is ridiculous!After 2 days we were called by Holden and told that some how the oil had leaked and made it's way into the water system which requires replacement and an entire flush and clean of the engine and some of the parts need to be sent away to be fixed.It has now been 11 days and they still have the car.The Captiva is a perfect car to look at, it's attractive, has a nice interior and is a very spacious family SUV. It is also very nice to drive, the diesel engine takes hills very easily and the cabin is almost soundproof. The only issue is the lag taking off, you can't quickly dart out in the diesel, it is slow off the mark.The electronic handbrake is also an excellent feature and much safer with children in the car as you need to have your foot on the brake to release the handbrake.After 2 years we have decided to sell.
Had mine 10 months (got it nov 12) been back to dealer 6 times. After 4000kms had an oil leak which they fixed. Managed to get to 15000kms. Then air con decided to play up fixed that. Back door seal broke that got fixed.Gear box was clunking apparently missing a part when it come off the line. Car had done 18000kms that got fixed. Now today i planned on driving to a holiday for school holidays and the starter motor blew.  To top it off i had to cancel a nights accommodation, add a night to kennelling fees, then waited for the car to be fixed.It had its initial 3000km serviceIts 15000 kms service and im now sitting on 24000kms and i hate the car. I will never buy a holden ever again, yes all parts are covered by warranty but its not the point.
I put my 2011 Captiva into the dealer for its 75000k service and they found it had rusty camshafts (imagine my surprise). Fortunately it was covered under warranty because it took 6 weeks of faffing around trying to get spares until the dealer finally decided to replace both heads. I went to Holden to discuss the possibility of an extended warranty for the engine (seems reasonable if its a bit rusty?) but they would not help (case 142840335) except to offer a fuel card. If you choose a Holden I recommend you also buy as much warranty as possible - Personally I will never be buying anything from them ever again.
We bought the series 2 cx captiva 7 in december 2011 and have never had a problem at all in the 30,000ks I've done never missed a beat!! Great space in rear when seats are up and very affordable! I also get around 10days to a tank of petrol with kinder, school runs etc!
Holden Service Procedure Ref. No. TL1784-0904 Group 6A acknowledges outer bearing race failure of the rocker needle roller bearings. It provides procedure to replace with plain type bearings, inspection of consequential damage, and mentions warranty claim information. In Production these bearings have been changed to the plain type bearings from engine number in brackets Z S0S1 (183103K). In Service vehicles are to be repaired IAW this SP.My Captiva 2007, out of warranty (140,000Kms) has just suffered a major engine problem, yet to be diagnosed, possibly this known fault...Until this happened I loved my Captiva... :(
Bought a 2013 Captiva 5 and i have absolutely loved driving it, the car looks fantastic and has the extra space that i was after, i love the high driving position, but do wish it had blue tooth and iPod connectivity, the series II is a much improved on series I and the extras including sunroof, 5 year warranty and roadside assist give me peace of mind (not that i have had to use them!) fixed price servicing is also fantastic!
I have owned my Ex Demo Captiva LX (5,500km) for 8 Weeks and in this small window of owning this vehicle I had an oil leak coming from the sump, repaired (Duration 8 Days), drove 50km checked it the next day and it was still leaking.It went in for repairs again and instead of simply doing the job again they decided to pull the engine out and also do the timing case seal (Not leaking in my opinion), Duration 10 Days. Drove across Melbourne and it broke down the very next day (13 hours 100km later). apparently a different problem and nothing to do with the major repair that had just been completed, still don't have reimbursement for hire car and I have to travel back across town to pickup the car once completed (during work hours) the repairs may take 1-2 weeks.I want my money back!
A friend's 2012 Captiva nad nothing but problems during 49000ks of owning the SUV, cheap interior that included rattles and plastic's not attached properly, replaced engine parts including starter moter $800, bad fuel economy-(false advertising),  the only thing that ended up being good is the wheels actually stayed on the vehicle long enough to take back to Holden and resell it. They are very unhappy with this experience, never buy another Holden, they rebadge too many car's aswell.
Thought it was a going to be a great car as it was series 2, wasn't the case. Car had a serious oil leak that Holden take no blame for and say its the first time they've heard of it.... (Living a lie, don't they read reviews). They patched it up 3 times before the national service matter instructed them to put the whole motor out and redo the seals. The car had to be sent in on a tow truck as the car had stopped working and oil had sprayed all under the car and right up the back. The service department are so unhelpful and rude. They give the impression you always have inconvenienced them. Took 3 weeks to fix after a lot of followup and they didnt even clean the car. still covered in oil. The car inside feels good but always has random things go wrong. Indicator speaker goes really loud, gear box jerks, turbo really slack, seat keeps moving down, water jets stop working.... Bad experience all round
My brother and I both bought 2006/2007 Captiva's. His started stalling a little over a year after purchase. Holden couldn't find the issue and when it began stalling while they were driving he demanded his money back. The process took months but because it was under warrenty Holden reluctantly agreed. My Captiva ran perfectly until the warrenty ran out. Since then the alternator has had to be rewired, wheel alignment is constantly out and now mine has the same problem with stalling while I'm driving it. It's stalled twice this week while I've had my 2 year old son in the back and I've barely been able to steer it off the road as the power steering goes at the same time. It is currently sitting at the Holden dealership (as they can't find the issue) and as it's unsafe to drive I'm tempted to leave the bloody car there. After looking at reviews this does not seem like an uncommon isse or isolated incident so why do we get the run around each time we take it back to Holden's service department and treated as though we are crazy for suggesting that there is a problem????My previous car was a Holden Vectra that caught fire in my driveway after an electrical fault. Holdens are Lemons..........speaking from experience, that's all I can say.
When looking for a new car the Captiva fitted all my criteria. Even though we have 4 children, i didn't want a hulking great big 4WD. I wanted a small 7 seater that was diesel, powerful enough, easy to drive with lots of bells and whistles! This is my car so usually it's just myself and the 4 children- (On the weekends my husband might also come in the car with us- so 6 altogether at those times)The captiva so far ( 3000 km) is great, size wise it's perfect ( I have 3 teens and 1 toddler- so only 1 car seat in the middle row).I love how the seats all fold flush to the floor, i only usually have 1 of the back seats up so i can pop groceries/school bags etc in the boot.It is economical and easy to drive. Seats are comfortable and i love the reversing camera and iphone/ipod connectivity.
Has been back to the dealer about 6 times in the last 8 months due to leaking sump, also wrong bolts put in sump at dealers, leaking gear box casing, unusual noise when driving (Whoop Whoop) sound from the front wheels, told this was a tyre problem, then to top it off was driving and and a thump thump noise started, stopped to check it was not a flat tyre, and hydraulic fluid was pouring from the gear box, apparently the diff in the gear box comes loose and drills a hole in the side of the gear box casing!!! Luckily we were not far from home so could get back home and park it in the garage until we got a tow truck to take it once again back to the holden dealer, awaiting an outcome but are without a car now for two weeks and the dealer could not give us a loan car for that long, we have to ring Holden head Office to get approval for one, lucky we have second car!! Consequently we are looking around for a NEW car, not Holden!!, which is a shame as we have owned three commodore's and they have each lasted 10 years, been wonderful. the current one has 305,000 on the clock and runs like a dream.
We bought a Captiva LX7 Diesel model last year in 2012-february.Last week we had the display screen for sat nav and all functions go completely blank and I could not get iit to operate, meaning nothing was displayed including rear view cam.Booked it with Roxburgh Parrk Mantello and today they advised they cannot diagnose the issue and have to refer me to Holden HQ. In te meantime, no one is able to assist and not sure when Holden HQ will respond with an appointment.not happy at all.
I bought brand new diesel LX straight away from dealer the driver seat move when stop or go.  I make complain to dealer and they say every new LX with electric seat does that, they even show me the one in the showroom does the same thing anyway at the end the change new plate seat and it a bit better but still move a little so I make complain to head office and they told me to go back to dealer and choose new car seat from showroom so I went back to dealer and they said they will choose the one that no problem for me to save my time and I haven't heard from them since.  I bought it from holden watson my case no is130324707. so now I have to till the seat all the way forward only so the seat won't move as much.  I bought it in Sep 2012.  Brand new car unbeliveable
I have just brought this car and although lovely to drive and yes a bit thirsty, Holden designers have a lot to answer for.  I ordered the car with a tow bar and a nudge bar which are holden accessories and so far have had nothing but trouble with having them.  The sensors at the front and the back pick up both items so when I get into the vehicle it buzzers annoyingly.  At the time the sales manager advised he could disconnect both of them, which I wasn't happy with so now we are trying for after market sensors so fingers crossed.  Will report back tommorrow.  Lucky I had all this fitted at Holden otherwise I would be the one paying for all this extra work!!
I have a 2.2l diesel LX 7. had the car 13 months back to dealer several times. 1) major oil leaks, dealer took 2 weeks to fix as they had to take the motor out. 2) car would not start, I had to pay to get car towed to dealer. dealer took 8 days to fix the issue (something with the turbo. ) 3) GPS gives directions that are incorrect around 5% of the time ( unfixable) 4) leather starting to peal of steering wheel and coulor on interior door handles wearing of ( apperntly my fault) 5) fan reving very hard for up to 3 minutes when car turned of ( not fixable apparently) 6) certain dash lights turning on for no reason then turning of a couple of days later. apparently not fixable. overall the car is just a really poor quality product.
I have had many issues not just with the car but with Holden staff and services right frm the day i picked it up. the car is terrible and after less than 18 months all the trims and bumper changed faded and changed colour. The car is bad, the servises are very expensive compared to other makes of cars and they dont get things done the first time. The last time my car was at holden, it was returned to me with not parking sensors connected. Is anyone else having issues with their bumpers and trims fading?
5km service was told oil leaking, needs to be fixed for 5 days. Then, after a 200km trip, we lost the sound of turning lights, chime and alarms of reverse censor. We were told by technician that it's software issue, but couldn't be fixed after reinstallation. 21st will be that day to fix all issues; hope everything gonna be fine. No more drama or it just began?!
I have a 2009 turbo diesel 7 seater and love it . Took it on a long 4 hour drive and found it to be as comfortable as my 06 Commodore.  I enjoy driving it and handling Is really good, It's a great car and I can't understand why some people are giving it such a bad review.
We are wrapped with our 2nd hand purchase of a LX Captiva Diesel.   Around town (if driven sensibly) we are ranging 10-11L/100k,  and yet to do a long highway drive but I expect close to or under 9lt/100k to be realistic.We are lucky with LX model with full leather on all 7 seats,  reverse parking sensors and removable tow bar.  Extras are great,  make live easier with kids and for spills on the seats.We have changed from a 150kw hatch to this car so the turbo diesel 2.0 is not lightning fast we agree, but the torque definitely makes up for it and I have complete confidence on towing a large load with the diesel.   5 speed auto gearbox is smooth as butter for us,  hard to notice the gear changes sometimes.We have 2 full size car seats in back (middle) of car, and we can still seat 1 adult next to these.  We are aiming for 3 kids and still feel we can fit a 3rd car seat in the middle,  tight but it will just fit.   That leaves 2 spare seats in rear if ever needed,  but limits storage roomFinally the boot area (with 2 seats down) is amazing for us,  we pile in the gear and have no issues in storing our double pram and gear when we go away.
This is the second Captiva I've had and I have to say that it really has been good value for money. Both have been Diesels and the first, a 2010 model CX was under powered when driving around town but OK on the open road. I now have the 2012 LX with the larger 2.2 litre turbo diesel engine which is more powerful and is better around town but not as responsive as a petrol vehicle. The 2012 model is less fuel efficient than the 2010 model. I get just over 10 litre/100km around town and about 8.8 for country driving. The 2010 model was 9 around town and 8 in the country. The 2012 LX  includes the built in Satnav and reversing camera as well as leather seats and a few other trinkets. The Satnav is pretty ordinary, the voice seems to nag about approaching turns every 100 meters from 500 meters out and was very quickly silenced after the kids complained. The interface for the navigation systems and the entertainment system is not that well designed or intuitive. Ours went back for a replacement when the screen failed on cold mornings, it would come good as the day warmed up, but the reversing camera uses the same screen and, well you need the excellent camera for backing out first thing in the morning. Repaired under warranty and a map update provided as well.This vehicle is comfortable, even on long trips. My wife and I are both tall and I find the seat and seating position very comfortable and the vehicle is easy to get in and out of due to the ride height. The third row of seats neatly fold up and the kids and cousins love to ride in them, although I'm not sure an adult would be comfortable back there for a long trip. Not too many airbags back there either, but perfectly adequate for carting kids around town. With then third row of seats folded down there is heaps of room for luggage.In summary, I get to drive many different types of vehicles for work, around town and for long country drives. I had the choice of any vehicle for work and looked at all the popular SUV's and,after a lot of consideration chose another Captiva. It's improved and full of features, couldn't go past a Captiva for value-for-money.
i have a 2008 holden captiva Diesel 60th anniversary, the issue i have is that the engine turns off while driving, then after starting the car again the engine light stays on. i took it to the mechanics they hooked it up on a computer and it came up as a Fuel Regulator. thats what they told me.!!any other idea what could stall the engine while driving and then having the engine light on??
Petrol engin is lively with the 6 speed auto transmission, seats are comfortable, instruments well layed out, suspension gives a comfortable ride, plenty of storage space, good fuel aconamy if driven sensiably, good trim for this price range, good stering position and ample adjustments. Cruse controle should be positioned on stearing wheel for ease of use , glove box and storage is well thought-out.
My 2.4 l diesel uses more fuel than our 3l Colorado, all the dealer can offer is the way we drive it, service manager said that the 8l /100 stated in their literature was in a wind tunnel. Will be passing it in as soon as practical and will never buy another Holden.
Had our car for few months now &generally love it. But has been to workshop twice, first for soft hole that collapsed, now updated & fine, second went into limp home mode in Blue Mountains, it had a loose loom under the console which shorted & sent the computer into partial shut down, Lithgow Holden fixed it in two hours, no charge & a loan car free while we waited. Drive to & from NSW was relaxing, comfortable & fuel economy quite good at 110 kmh & air on most of the time.
I am totally impressed with my Captiva 7. It is great in the snow, has never let me down on soft sandy tracks, & has no problems with sticky, clay & mud that would bog down a conventional car. Is it a true 4WD? Absolutely not - but when put to the test has yet to fail me. I have also found the decent control to be very useful. With leather interior, sunroof, excellent reversing camera & reversing sensors (great for getting out of tight situations in the bush - or simply reverse parking). Looked at the Mazda MX7 & MX9 - too much money for too little car, Territory not impressed, Toyota Kluger a "Klanger". Loads of room inside (lay down fron passenger seat great for those long loads) & great for long trips (now comleted 76,000kms in just over 2 years). While not a sports car (at just about 2 tonnes) it performs very well & meets my expectations in this area. Good all round view for the driver & passengers.
2007 lx AWD Holden captiva is a lemon. 16 l per 100 km very hard on tyres. Fuelnpump failed, electoral/ computer fail, timing chain stretched and motor needs removing to adjust( $ 3800.) The rear tail lights constantly  blow bulbs and the roll on the suspension is hard and wears out tyres. It digs in. the car has been a total  waste. Of money and cheaply made but expensively sold !
Worked in the government {in the country}and was using Captivas all the time, these cars just shake themselves to bits, the plastic interiors just wouldn't stay where it was supposed to be. These cars are a poor compromise, they're not a good vehicle on the road, they are NOT an off-road vehicle and don't do anything well.   I found that you sit very low in the car , it felt like the door was almost up to your shoulder giving poor visuals
Have a 2010 Holden Captive 2.4L petrol and its rubbish - the engine is a slug and drinks like a fish Various bits of trim have fallen off the car and its horrible to driveWish I'd never bought it - tried to trade it in and was offered $8k less than I still owe on it !Not sure sure why others say its great as in my opinion it's the worst car I have ever owned Will never buy Holden again
Read all bad reviews about Captiva and taught the car is rubbish, but then decided to go and test drive one for myself. Was very surprised as the car totally exceeded my expectations. Bought Captiva in diesel engine and whole family excited wanting to go for more trips. Especially comfortable for longer trips. Suspension is great and composed. All the complaints about seats are untrue as I have found them stiff but ergonomic and supportive. Done 1000kms and averaging 9.5l/100kms which should come down to claimed 8.1l/100kms when engine worn in (15-20k). I also tried territory and kluger but found them overpriced and even the toyota had an "egg carton" feel and disastrous handling.
Just changed the battery. HAS to have a Delkor 59095 sealed battery. with the 'terminals on different sides' to normal. Dealer chat for non-standard / proprietary or expensive!$306 smackeroos. Nearly fell over (after he had it in). Others had quoted $239. still pretty high.Fule usage still around 10.8/100km after 2 years and 40000 km Petrol battery is different, and probably better fuel consumption.Seats are a little harder than I like. Other car is ford au sedan.
Captiva 7 LX 2.2Lt Diesel with 3000km on the clock, the engine has decent grunt for a diesel and is responsive. Fuel consumption is terrible with a combined driving average of 11litres / 100 km. I now have an oil leak, which I noticed on previous reviews appears to be common to the captiva. The entertainment system is frustrating, and sometimes has a mind of its own. The onboard GPS cannot be relied on, it sometimes tries to navigate me on routes which I know cannot be correct. Its now going into Holden for a three day repair, and they tried to tell me to hire my own car! After some convincing they will be lending me one.  Never again Holden, in three year time I'll be buying a Japanese or European car.
2.2 ltr turbo diese we have got 6.5000klms on the clock took it to the snow love it and can tow my new boat with it no problems. plenty of power.But it is  going back to holden for the third  time due to a oil leak in the bell housing this is only a 5 month old car.
Recently purchased the Captiva LX 2.2 litre Diesel - It is the first diesel I have owned so it appears sluggish. The car itself has a nice interior and all the items you want in a car but I have issues with fuel consumption. Advertised at 10.8 litres/100km Urban , I cannot get near that on freeway driving where is us advertised and 6.8 litres/100. I have done 5000km now and are averaging 13.8litres /100kms.. For diesel this would have to be the worst performing Diesel SUV on the market.I have it for 4 years but can't wait for that 4 years to end
I purchased a 2012 Captiva 2 V6 petrol CX having traded in my second X-Trail. I have found the seats in the Captiva really hard and in fact have just sold it with 1100 kms on the clock!! It has been a financial disaster, having spent over $500.00 on Holden wool seat inserts and about 4 other type of back support. I know my back is crook, but these seats are terrible. Holden service said they could not find anything wrong with the seat. It feels like the lumbar support is out all the time even though it is fully off. In my limited driving I have already found rear vision when parking is difficult and it seems very heavy on fuel. I am not a fan of the electric handbrake, although would have put up with everything else in this lovely vehicle, but the seats have finished me off.
I have had my 2009 Captiva Diesel 3 years. At 18 months its Clutch had completely burnt itself out costing me 3000 to fix because Holden said it wasn't a warrantable part. 8 months later it went again costing 3500 to fix. Have driven manuals for 30 years - no problems, have never had a lemon like this.The entire engine has to come out to replace it. Not happy Jan
I really like this car. I was going to buy a subaru forester but it wasn't big enough to take my surfboards without putting them on the roof. I like how I can just fold down 1 seat and put all my boards in the back. I'm surprised by the amount of room in it. From the outside it looks like a compact 4wd but feels roomy on the inside. I think at the new price these cars were a bit expensive and out of my price range but as a second hand car they seem good value for money. I just hope the maintenance is not too high!
Just back from doing over 5000kms in my 2011 series 2 diesel LX in the Kimberleys including some pretty rough off road stuff (if you've been up the Kalumburu road you'll know what I'm talking about), through about 40 water/river crossings up to around 500mm deep, towing an off road camper trailer and the car performed really well.Made a couple of changes to the car including replacing the springs with some Kings Springs to increase the clearance by an inch or two and getting some 17" wheels in place of the 19" ones the car comes with so I could fit some off road tyres (Cooper A/T3). This was certainly helpful when driving on beaches and on sandy tracks. Had one flat tyre which was annoying but that wasn't the fault of the car.The automatic AWD system performed faultlessly and it certainly got plenty of work out pulling the car and trailer out of some of the water crossings. Car handled reallly well on the dirt roads, excellent control driving over the corrugations and sandy bits. We even rescued our friends in their Prado when they became bogged in the sand. The sealing was excellent with no dust leaking in whilst driving, though you can't avoid the dust getting in so the car was somewhat red inside by the time we finished. I was concerned about the lack of guarding underneath the car, but fortunately didn't have any issues thought the guard over the fuel tank does have a dint in it.You can't come back from driving through that country without any issues and there are some with the car, though nothing serious (I hope - it's going back to the dealer tomorrow for a good check over). The main things were the bits of plastic panelling around the wheel arches coming loose, particularly at the front of the back wheel arches (2 plastic bits which both came off). Some of these are held on with screws which worked loose after several million corrugations, others use plastic rivet type fasteners which weren't really up to the job. Would recommend going around all these types of fasteners and placing a good blob of silicone over the top of them if planning a bumpy off road trip in a Captiva. The main issue of concern is the excess engine noise whilst driving the car - don't know what the problem is but the car still drives fine. It happened suddenly whilst driving back from Mitchell Falls in the middle of nowhere and hasn't changed since that time. The rear parking sensor also stopped working once we started towing, but never started working again. The camera still works - the camera was found to be brilliant when hitching up the trailer. I could do it by myself! The 65L fuel tank is a bit limiting when outback - we carried about 45L in gerry cans as well, which gave us up to 700km range, which was more than adequate.In summary, the Captiva is very capable off road, certainly on sandy, bumpy tracks and went through water without issues. It was relatively efficient (averaged around 15l/100km which I don't think was too bad given we were towing a fully loaded trailer on some pretty average dirt roads). So unless you're planning on doing some real serious off road stuff like water up to the windscreen or a long way from civilisation, you can save yourself lots of money by getting a Captiva rather than a more expensive 4WD.
Everything you have heard in the media are true. I have the 7 seater LX diesel and it is just problems after problems. I got mine from the Liverpool dealership and they are more lazy than council workers. All items on the pre-delivery checklist were ticked even though the carpet were missing and took them 3 months to find it. The alarm had integration problems and they refuse to fix it as it was not a Holden product. The sidesteps are very flimsy and I had gone through 3 pairs of the DVD headsets in the first 6 months as they kept breaking. The trim panel under the steering wheel were falling off and the service people just forced it back in and said it is fixed (until it falls off again 5 minutes later). The metal trim on the tailgate is peeling off and stopping the hatch door opening. The computer had to be reloaded twice as it was interfering with the driving. Sometimes it doesn't even let the car start. The headlamp is burning a brown ring into the plastic. And the car is not even 2 years old yet! The design intent was good but the implementation is extremely poor.
The petrol Captiva is very hungry, the models I have driven have returned no better than 13litres per 100km, which for a small style AWD is awful. The V6 petrol engine is also under powered. The Turbo diesel engine has a noticeable turbo lag, but is probably a better choice over the petrol model, but lacks top ebd over taking speed when trying to get past trucks. The interior is boring and very plastic and flimsy – the styling a little cartoonish. Best to avoid and look at the rest of the pack, the Hyundai Santa Fe would certainly beat Captiva in every way, look here instead.
Back and forwards to delaership .Less than 4000kms oil leak .Had vehicle for a week. And problems continue and still on going .Plastic moulding wheel arches etc discoloured. I have x2 Captiva's unluck me also has oil leaks. Workmanship poor no matter where it they are take for repair x1 Suppossedly Serviced oil filter not screwed on properly developed oil leak . Another repair components poorly assembled e.g bolts not properly fitted. My Company has them as fleet cars .X1 Burnt was replaced .2nd Vehicle engine blew up and replaced. Met Someone with top of the range Calais Commmodore owner of Strathfield Car Radio Last 10 years endless problems and Holden won't do anything for him.My advice stay away from Holden all together save yourself heart ache and pain.
Stay away from Holden Captiva 7 LX Series II, had the car for 6 weeks, did the first check at 3000Km they failed to find any problems, one week later it started to leak oil from the engine seal They probably saw the problem coming but did not want to say anything about it at such an early stage. Their mechanic said they had to replace the seal on many of these vehicles because the seal they put is very weak. Holden said bad luck we will only replace the seal, This wasn't the only problem with this vehicle, electric problems, Windows and sun roof intermittently won't work, Rear door does not close properly, inside door covers keeps coming off, Stay away from Holden don't waste your money there. The Dealer response and the company response, was bad luck we will only repair the engine.Who wants to buy a $48000 car with a repaired engine! 6 weeks old and 3000km on the clock
Captiva 7 LX Series11 purchased 10/11/2011. Fuel tank replaced after 2 weeks & since oil leak sump tray resealed, Loose bolt in gear box,Oil leak timing cover resealed.Thumping noise in rear when braking diagnosed as fuel sloshing.Service manager reckons all Captivas are like this ? I dont think they want to know its all too hard. Will they tell this to potential purchasers?
Bough a Holden Captiva LX series diesel in February 2012, from day one it had an oil leak.  Took the car in on 2000km to have it checked, the dealer cleaned the engine and said there is no leak.  On 2690km I took it back, today the dealer informed me I'll be without a car for a week as the engine has to come out!  This on a brand new car with only 2690km. They have to replace the engine cover at the bottom as that is where the leak is.
my one is second, 2006 ,LX ,7seats $22000. just in 10 months, the left indicator not work if it not happy.the alternator not work. which cost me $800 at Sutton Holden . after two weeks, it make a breakdown on traffic Peak time and block a busy Street,Listen, hundreds person fk me. NRMA tow me to Sutton Holden. $1200 for replace oil pump again. now*I can hear some voice from left wheel bottom when drive on bad road. mechanical man can not 100% tell me what is that. *when I start the engine, I turn the key but nothing happened  unless i try over 6,7 times, which happen at least twice a week.go to repair them? who knows how much bills waiting for me!.
I've had the 7 seater Captiva SX for 5 weeks now, it runs pretty well, fuel consumption is ok. Having driven around Brisbane city and suburbs, the consumption is standard, I can probably get 400kms on a full tank. In the 5 weeks I've had it I drove from Brisbane to Adelaide, the fuel consumption is heaps better, I can get a just over 600kms on a full tank. The only problem I'm having now is the hose for the windscreen wipers must have detached, as I was using it the water suddenly stopped and started squirting out on the left hand side of the headlights, I've got it booked in to get looked at. As it's only a tiny little problem I'm hoping that's all i'll have with it..fingers crossed! Overall still very happy with the car, it's just annoying that I'm already getting a little problem with it and I've barely had it for a month
For the price we paid, we can not buy anything on the market that has so much features and good looking than the Captiva Series II LX Diesel. Driven 200kms so far, found the car to be very comfortable and I enjoyed every moment I was in it. Firstly, the engine was a bliss. the torque is so powerful that I can overtake at any moment. The transmission goes really well with the engine that it doesn't feel like you are driving an SUV.The cabin is also very quiet with very good sound insulation. Many reviewers said the suspension is too stiff, but I actually quite like it as it greatly helped to reduce body roll during corners.Do not believe everything you hear from most australian car reviews, I think they devalue the Captiva to be something that is quite bad but in actual fact its a car that does really well in many areas. Guys, if I have to get an SUV with the same features from another car manufacturer, I have to pay at least $6000 more. Well done Holden.
We recently purechased MY2010 (plated 2011) series 1 Captiva LX in AWd diesel.We love the leather trim, all the fancy extras and the sat nav is great!We have three kids and fit our three car seats across the middle row.
Series 2 Captiva 7 CX.We bought a 3 month old 2011 demo for under $40k. Pretty happy with what we get for the money. Compared to the Kluger (my other option) it was way better value for money. 7 seats are handy when we get the tag along kids, but when the rear 2 seats are in use ou have almost no boot space. andbag space only really.We have managed to fit 2 foam style booster seats in 3rd row when needed but there are no anchor points. so really only designed for kids in foam boosters that dont require anchorage or kids under 12/13 as height will start to become an issue. (However i have fit two 20something Y.O guys in there to drop my sister and friends in to town. just they arent that comfortable with their knees around their ears)Middle row has good leg room even when front seats far back. good width and it looks like I'll get a baby seat and a booster seat alongside each other and still fit another if needed. there are 3 anchor points for seats in the middle row.Bott space is awesome when the 3rd row is flat and even better for bunnings trips when both rows are flat. the way the seats fold means its a flat space from boot to the back of the front seats. quite clever!(We could fit a wheelbarrow in easily.)Controls on the dash and steering wheel are a bit fiddly. It will take some practce and getting used to as the buttons are close together on the soundsystem/air con etc. As for steering wheel- the controls on there where perhaps an over kill. cruise control, volume and blue tooth would have been enough, but they threw in fan controls??front seats are comfy and lots of driving positions and flexibility with tilt adjust etc on steering wheel column. window wipers are on the left side but take some getting used to as you push up, not down to put them on. And the rear window wiper also takes some practice.I loved the idea of the window opening on the rear door, but havent actually used it yet?! reverse sensors were a bonus. Wouldnt want an SUV sized car without them. (the LX modle comes with camera as well)Drives well and turning circle is OK. Parking took some getting used to (other car is still a large car)with the turning though.Petrol consumption is high. We run around 12L/100km. On a highway trip interstate we recorded around 10L/100km. However it lacks guts when you hit the hills (used in manual mode to help get the power) Apparently the diesel one runs cheaper.All in all we are pretty happy with it. just a shame about fuel consumption.
We recently upgraded from our Rav 4 to a Holden Captiva based on Safety rating reviews, fuel consumption and internal space.  We're really happy with our upgrade, we just got the base model 2010 Holden Captiva 5 which suits our family of 4 perfectly.  The internal space is great, my knees were touching the front console in the Rav4 with a baby seat in the back, but there is finally plenty of room in the Captiva, great fuel consumption, we average around 10L per 100km in city driving with lots of short trips (much better for country trips).
2012 Captivated 7 CX DieselOK so after an epic wait for delivery (14 weeks) I have had the Captiva for two weeks of solid driving. I do a lot of Kms on the freeway and a few short runs about town. So far no issues. Its a good work horse, power but not thirsty. Plastic here and there wth waaay too much fake carbon fibre panels in the interior. Free sidesteps are more of a nuisance than an aid to get in/out of the car. But the ride is good, comfortable with space for everyone in my house plus two more. Its still a compact SUV that sits between a RAV4 and a CX9. Definitely not an off road vehicle but a family car. If you want something that's a good people mover, but not too big to park at Target, economical on fuel that handles like a station wagon then this is ideal. For the price its excellent value for an imported car with good support in Australia.
love the car but hate the problems, always have keek taking it back as they can't find anything wrong with the car when the this are working so i have to keep taking it back as it stops working if it happens on a weekday, not happy as i have 4 kids 6,4,1 & newborn and in this heat is not good as we spent alot of money on a new car so we had something relyable not stressfull.
I am really disappointed in the Captiva and the response from Holden. They keep fixing the same problem! The car is clearly a lemon and should be recalled or replaced. Its going to cost us money to get rid of this piece of junk.Thanks Holden.
Captiva 5 is a lemon! Died during right turn across oncoming traffic! Not safe! Holden trying to find a way to fix problem. Hopeless! Fuel guzzler like you wouldn't believe. Volume control? What volume control?
I still like the look and the feel of the car.  It is quite comfortable and the 7 seats are convenient.  But the fuel efficiency really lets it down.
I have 2, 2011 Captiva 7's in diesel at work 16,000 and 20,000 k's. I drive one everyday. Overall great cars but both have suffered major gearbox failures resulting in new gearboxes for both. GMH have replaced under warranty as they have recognised the fault which has resulted from a bolt coming loose in the diff/trans area basically acting like a lathe and cutting a groove into the gearbox resulting in loss of drive and oil.
Good and the bad all in one? Even cars costs 3 times have major issues.  Whish we had a comparison site like in the USA for all break downs AND we need LEMON LAWS ASAP
Bought our 2009 LX Captiva 7 seater new. From day one, there were issues with the cruise control, sat nav and the heater blasing cold air. We failed on inspection to realise just how small the car is inside. We have 4 boys, 16, 14, 4 & 2. The seats just don't work. Having two baby seats, there is no room to sit between them and the rear seats leave no where for a teen ager to put their feet (or get in and out). And you can forget about a pram or any bags once the back seats are up. The rear seats should be called emergency seats, because they would only be good in a jam. What really got up my nose was the dealership. They laughed at us when we had to keep taking it back because of various problems. It's almost like Holden have said, you bought it, now it's your problem. Last 6 months have been pretty good, we have excepted heating has a mind of it's own, the dash lights go bright and dull when every they feel like it, the blinkers may or may not come on, the sat nav usually has us driving through paddocks. We noticed a light was sitting funny and were told a replacement headlight was around $1200 fitted.  But that's ok, we only spent $49,000, you can't really expect much.  I also dented the bonnet closing it, not slamming it, just closing it.
Have been driving the Holden Captiva for a couple of weeks and have to say I am not a big fan. It feels like I am driving a truck and it is so hard to park. It has a massive turning circle - bigger than most large four wheel drives. The only good thing about it, is it does have a fair amount of power.
The best SUVin the market at an affordable price.It is an everyday car with great off road capabilities.The 2.2diesel CX is a good ride with plenty of oomph.The ride equality is superb unlike some reviews say.Not  sure if Holden has retuned the suspension of Captiva.I am particularly impressed by its off road efficiency.The engine is smooth and other features like Hill descent  control is quite handy.It may be a Daewoo in a Holden skin,but it is a great package
I have the 7 seater LX petrol model and have been very happy with my purchase. I haven't had any issues with it. I can fit my family in it, I will have three kids in car seats soon and they will all fit in the middle row. We have also been extensively renovating our house, so have used it many times with all the seats down to bring building materials home. We have also towed trailers many times with no issues. I do tend to travel on motorways a lot which keeps my petrol consumption down. On the open road the petrol consumption is as advertised.
We got rid of our Subaru Forester and upgraded to the Captiva. we chose a 2010 CX Turbo Diesel. The car is great. We use it to tow our windsor sunwagon around which weighs 1200kg and have no problems whatsoever. We purchased the captiva 2nd hand and it had all the optional extras like Tow Bar, Sunroof(which the kids love), side steps and tinted windows. The car has a lot more backseat space and around the same boot space as the forester. It fits our mountain buggy no worries and the shopping. space is tight when rear row is used but you must expect that.
Have done almost 5,000km and this is enought mileage to get an idea on how the car behaves. It's not a great handling SUV, the chasis and suspension design let the car down. The 5 speed transmission is very stubborn in that it doesn't change down quick enough when you need to go. Also the lack of torque doesn't help the car either especially when you need to move 1800kg in a hurry. I have noticed that the brakes tend to make a bit of noise when the pads get hot. I raised this with Holden and they informed me it was normal caliper operation. My impression is that it's not the best caliper design. Something that I read on another blog that I didn't believe till I experienced it myself was that if you really need to accelerate there have been 3 occasions when immediately after thumping the accelerator, a rotten egg gas smell fills the car. I was thinking it was my imagination till my 3 year old said 'what's that smell ?'Mileage is not great, I get 15L/100km city driving. That's about 430km on a 65L tank. Well it is a V6 and heavy car. The stereo controls on the steering wheel are a little odd in that you can forward to the next CD track but can't go backwards. Apart from the irks of the car, there are good points too. Rear Cargo space is generous, the 3rd row of seats are actual real seats, unlike some other SUVs that give you an ironing board to sit on. General overall vision is pretty damm good ! The rear vision mirror is nice with the light sensor, so at night time it acts dimms the look of rear car lights, making the driving experience a bit safer. On the LX model the rear vision camera is very helpful in those tight spaces. I owned a CX7 before this car but traded it in as it was a 5 seater and there was a growing need to accomodate 7 people. If you are in the market for an affordable 7 seater the Captiva is an ok car, as long as you are not expecting great driving dynamics, road handling and great performance. Remember it is an SUV after all. However if all you need is a 5 seater, there are much better SUVs on the market, obviously the CX7 wins hands down ! It is a real ripper of a car in every way !
The Captiva looks compact up until you drive it. On the road it is a little under braked and the driver's position is just something i could not get used too. It came with Power options and Sunroof, Stacker cd,cruise,Alloys, Air Con ,Power front Seats, Keyless Entry and Aiming Camera for reverse parking with Leather Seats. On the road it is a little loud the V6 when asked to perform and appears to lack a decent Torque output. Interior plastics are cheap in some departments in particular around the steering wheel and including the wheel. Driving it it feels cumbersome around corners with a strange im going to tip over feeling from the back. I would not pay the money that they are asking for one and i would go Japanese for what this kind of money can get.
Leather interior is cheap and stretches out of shape quickly. My wife and I are not heavier than average (NGT 85kg, me). With regards to the above, I have had more warranty issues with this NEW car than all the cars I have owned in 25 years of driving. I would NOT buy another one. It is not Aussie built and no Holden service staff have any idea about these cars. They just say, "Yeah, that is bad" Does not help us in any way? I bought the 60th Anniversary model and paid top $$. Too much considering the issues raised. An ok work car, but would not want to use it to travel long distances. Dont trust it. Servicing is EXPENSIVE. 6L of oil is $130!! For warranty you MUST use the GMH Daewoo oils supplied. Sucks.
I have just bought a Holden Captiva 5 series II diesel (Manufactured May 2011) and I am really happy with it so far. I read a lot of reviews and did quite a few test drives and in the end the Captiva ticked the most boxes for me. Many of the reviews of similar sized SUV's put the Kia Sportage Diesel and the Nissan X Trail Diesel as half a star better. I found the Kia too small, and with a wait of months to get one, plus inflated quoted prices (I assume due to the shortage) it did not seem a good option. And whilst I liked the X-Trail and could have lived with it happily I didn't think it was so much better as to warrant the extra $4000 price tag. I wanted four main things, flexible large luggage space, comfortable driving, fuel economy and a good value price tag. On balance, the Captiva delivered on all these and after a 1000km driving in city and country I am more than happy with the result. Just for interest sake, the other cars I looked at were the Outlander (noisy drive and poor usable luggage space due to clumsy seat folding) the X-trail and Kia Sportage as mentioned, The iX35 and dualis (too small for me) and Rav4 (uncomfortable driving position as I'm pretty tall). Other cars of similar size like Subaru and Mazda seemed to start off at a couple thousand more so I didn't include them.
We haven't had car long but find it a much nicer ride than our prado.  Plenty of room and packed with extra features.
Great value for money has all the extras not included in many other new cars, powerful and comfortable to drive. Tows the trailer easily and is economical to travel in. Very happy with our purchase.
consumptionstop start it struggles to get 450 k to a tank. On the open road it gets 600k.This translates to range of 8 to 10 litres per 100 k.It is very roomy for passengers , thedriver and storage space is great.Its high and easy to get in and out of which is important for soem of my  +50 worn out bits
Captiva LX= drives well,it is easy to park and I have found it do be really good on fuel(petrol). the leather seats make for easy cleanng. i have four kids(set of twins)and the back seat is big enough for the two cars sets and also a booster seat. the rear of the cars is big enough for my daughter to sit as well as still fitting the pram and everything else i need to take. (with four kids you need everything bar the kitchen sink)and as the rear seats fold completely flat you lose no space in the boot area. we had to sell the Nissan Navara as we needed more room. when finind a new car we really looked at the stearing as the navara could'nt do a three point turn on a football oval, but the captive is fantastic!! all in all I have found nothing wrong with this car. It is great to drive and looks very stylish, anyone looking at the captiva i strongly recomend it! It is the best car i have ever owned
Well My Captiva was a blessing, not only did it save our lives( luckily just my daughter and i in the car).But if we were not involved in that crash the lady and 2x children in the Camry in front of me would have been squashed. So it saved their lives as well.  I was 8 1/2 months pregnant too and managed to walk away without too much damage (baby's fine... still waiting to give birth!!)I am currently in the Process of getting a new one through insurance and i am 100% satisfied with my choice of car !!
Great car, you realy feel like you have moved to the next level of car design, we traded are Berlina which was fine but now we are so happy. Seven seats and high riding is great.  We love it and as it's a desile we keep it for many years to come.  We note that a few issues have been raised with the driving position, it's a four wheel drive what else would you expect.  The economy is great and that's very important to us it's the reason we wanted to change cars.  We now can pile in toghther and drive off knowing that we are safe and comfortable. We love it!
I rarely use the 7 seats but having the option is great when driving extra kids around. The back seats are quite spacious in leg room. The car has 3 power outlets which is great for travelling with the kids and recharging the endless DVD machines etc.  I have the CX model and find the parking sensors are a great help, I didn't think I would like this option but really find it useful. I think these cars look good and are a pleasure to drive. The diesel has been a fabulous choice for me and I have noticed the savings at the petrol station.
I left this review on Caradvice i've added a little more.I received a brand new Holden Captiva II LX two weeks ago. Sadly its been in and out of the service department with an electrical fault that I’m sure has the guys stumped. Something to do with what ever controls the ABS, hill descent, stability control, I'm guesssing as these are the warning lights that are flashing. This is getting pretty tough to take as I choose the Captiva over the territory because of the problems I had with my Falcon G6 (the Territory’s platform) build quality, trim feel off, the centre consol pulled out every time I unplugged my satnav, the Bluetooth did not want to work with an Iphone, but most important I had a real bad gas leak on it that was extremely dangerous.Back to the Captiva the guys have done their best to accommodate me with loan cars and things, but I do have a feeling its going to turn into a lemon.Well ths is the extra bit Its a Lemon...........still haviong problems, the media system keeps turning on and off and the fault is back. Its the control modules, (for cruise control, ABS, hill start etc) Holden fixed the first problem by taking modules out of a another brand new car. They changed all of them as couldn't pin point the exact one causing the problem.They all say they are sorry but when i ask for a new car they don't want to discuss stay away from the car and Holden.I'm a company car driver so i get to keep this pup for 4 years. I will not be going to holden again and neither will any of my guys. This is a fault that you can't fix yourself, by the nature of it I can't belive its going to be limted to mine. Good luck selling these second hand.Holden how about changing this piece of rubbish and solving my problem?
Captiva LX: after driving this  all wheel drive it is very smooth under power and to ride in i was extremly impressed with its handling for such a large all wheel drive.the motor is quiet compaired with the popular commondore (note the miss spelling) and has little transmission noise .it is lacking on features in the cx and lx ie trip computer leather and all the extras that the maxx model comes with .all in all a great all wheel drive
Captiva LX: Really surprised me. I was expecting a Daewoo dog but ended up with a Korean kracker! Amazingly useful. I took it to the beach via 70kms of dirt and it didn't miss a beat. No rattles either. The engine could do with the higher output and the brakes leave a bit to be desired. But overall, the equipment levels and performance for the money make it a great buy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
have just done 45,000 KLMS in Captiva over 6 months it has proformed well as a reps car in that time and would recommend it to any one looking at one.had Toyota Kluger before, thought I would miss it but havn't
Overall I like the car. However after writing the Cons, I feel a little crazy saying its a good package. Get the quality issues right and enjoy the sales Holden.
Being a sales rep, I was after a car that had plenty of room for samples and a car that was going to be fuel efficient. I also wanted something safe with a good "field of view". After buying the CX Diesel, I am 100% sure I picked the right car. I thought the diesel might be a little noisy at first, but you rarely even notice, the power and response is magnificent and the fuel efficiency is amazing. I have driven 43,000km in 8 months in this car, and have never been as happy with a car purchase as I am now.
After researching a change of car for new baby I decided upon a 2007 CX petrol. I enjoy this car, roomy, smooth, petrol consumption not too bad, comfortable and never had any problems with it thus far.  I found Holden Captiva value for money, and that's exactly what it produced.  Easy to get baby in and out of the car, fits so much at the back and love the extra two seats in case I need them.  The car is an all over pleasure to drive.
Owned Captiva lx diesel for 4 weeks odometer 950klm  fuel economy 16 litres/100klm rang delaers service department  to complain i was  told will have to run the car for 5000 to 6000 klm to run the engine in this is not stated in the handbook.when i ask them what will the figure reduce to after this period they stated that they do not know as this depends on my drive style .The claimed 8.5 litres per 100 klm is questionable.
I am going to give it another go as I have ordered a diesel. some of the reviews here re bad economy with diesels is a bit of a worry. I cant believe some are saying its great economy and others are saying its almost as bad as what I experienced with the petrol one. Time will tell.
There are many annoying things about the Captiva. Things that shoud have been ironed out by now such as the silly automatic headlight sensor is too sensitive. When crawling along a tree lined street slowley in traffic, the headlights switch on everytime you pass under a shadey tree, then turn off when you move out from under the tree. The bonnet is difficult to close, at the first service the mechnanic must have found it difficult to close the bonnet and managed to put a dint in the flimsy bonnet. The auto air-conditioner blasts out cold air when it's 5C outside and you have the internal temp set to 23C. In summer the air-conditioner blasts away flat out when you turn the vehicle on on a hot day. there are no air conditioning or ventilation outlets in the rear compartments at all. I imagine if you have anyone in the 3rd row seats on a hot day they are going to find it pretty uncomfortable. The thing tat scares me the most is that the diesel engine dies when you pull out at an intersection shortly after start-up. There is clearly a fault here, the engine is starved of power  or fuel.Several times I have been left stranded mid-way out of an intersection. I'm now very cautious when pulling out after first startup. I've had the vehicle back at the dealers but they haven't a clue. I've had 25 years experience driving diesel Landrovers and Landcruisers and never had a similar problem. I like the space, the Captiva has plenty of room , it's a good family car without being a massive tank like a Kluger or Landcruiser. I'm willingto recommend the car to others with a young family but overall it is dissapointing car, could be better. Unless there are some basic improvements to the things I have griped about above, I don't think I would buy another one when the one I have is traded in 18 months time. I should mention the automatic gearbox is poorly set-up too, fliiers back and forward between 3rd and 4th when driving around town at 60KM/H.
I have the LX petrol 2009 Captiva 7 seat. If you want cheaper alternative for 7 seat 4WD this is a good choice compare to Toyota Kluger or Subaru Tribecca. There is no aircondition at the 2nd and 3rd row.Summer time could be a problem for anybody who sits at the 3rd row. The inside design not very nice. I found the car is a bit bouncy.But this car has a plenty of room.
We are so happy with our Captiva LX 2008. Its roomy, handles well, very  comfortable and quite economical. Considering its a All Wheel Drive the fuel  consumption is reasonable. Recently I hit a emu and the car handled the smash  extremely well. It did not crumble as much as others would have. Its a 7 seater  with the two seats in the boot which are comfortable and has lots of leg room,  Im 6 foot tall and find it easy to travel in the back. All the standard mod cons  are in this car as well as leather seats. Servicing is affordable thru Holden. I  would recommend Holden Captiva LX to anyone who is considering buying a AWD.
I needed a car that seated 7, could fit a pram and could fit 3 full sized baby seats across the back seat. This car did all of this, so my complete and utter amazement (OK, 6 seats + pram). This is a deceptively spacious car for what I can consider a small-medium sized car. It has everything we need and want in a car and cannot fault it in anyway. The fact we could fit all 3 kids in the back seat in their seats sold me. No issues with it. No way it is going off road, but it is capable, reliable and easy to park. Great for the mum who does the school run and shopping.
Very happy with purchase LX 08. Had DVD player fail.... still not repaired under warranty (been 2 months). Great family wagon. This wagon comfortably tows trailer with boot full and 2 adults 3 kids.
